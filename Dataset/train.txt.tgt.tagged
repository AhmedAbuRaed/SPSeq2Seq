<t>based on tree structures of various complexity in the tree adjoining grammar model. using such tags, <cite> has achieved the automated tagging of a syntactic structure based set of grammatical function tags including phrase chunk and syntactic role modifiers trained in supervised mode from a tree bank of german.. </t>
<t>to overcome this problem, linguistic parsing and generation systems are used in the sentence condensation approaches of <cite> and <cite>. in these approaches, decisions about which material to include delete in the sentence summaries do not rely on relative frequency information on words, but rather on probability models of subtree deletions that are learned from a corpus of parses for sentences and their summaries.. </t>
<t>therefore, we only use manual transcriptions of these lectures. synthetic corpus also as part of our analysis, we used the synthetic corpus created by<cite> which is commonly used in the evaluation of segmentation algorithms.. </t>
<t><cite> built an ensemble of naive bayesian classifiers, each of which is based on lexical features that represent co occurring words in varying sized windows of context.. </t>
<t>note that the dependency figures of dienes lag behind even the parsed results for johnson s model  this may well be due to the fact that dienes built his model as an extension of <cite>, which lags behind <cite> by about #.# #.# . manual investigation of errors on english gold standard data revealed two major issues that suggest further potential for improvement in performance without further increase in algorithmic complexity or training set size.. </t>
<t>an unsupervised method <cite> is employed to detect grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from toefl administrated by ets.. </t>
<t>like the work of <cite> and <cite>, our work was inspired by the summarization method used by human abstractors.. </t>
<t>our work is more related to <cite> in the sense that we also use a large collection of generation templates for surface realization, but still distinct in that we intend to generate text from minimal input.. </t>
<t>complicated relation extraction tasks may also impose a big challenge to the modeling approach used by <cite> which integrates various tasks such as part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, template element extraction and relation extraction, in a single model.. </t>
<t><cite> presented the first method for assigning penn functional tags to constituents identified by a parser.. </t>
<t>in a sense this is encouraging, as it motivates our most exciting future work  augmenting this simple model to explicitly capture complementary information such as distributional semantics <cite>, diathesis alternations <cite> and selectional preferences <cite>.. </t>
<t>the appendix in <cite> lists the analysis of a small text.. </t>
<t>this paper addresses the area of text generation known as micro planning <cite>, or sentence planning <cite>.. </t>
<t>the phrases in our bibliographic and clinical samples were then submitted to an underspecified syntactic analysis described by <cite> that draws on a stochastic tagger (see <cite> for details) as well as the specialist lexicon, a large syntactic lexicon of both general and medical english that is distributed with the umls.. </t>
<t>part of speech tags are assigned by brill s tagger <cite>.. </t>
<t>on the one hand, the linguistically based or rule based approaches use linguistic information such as pos tags, chunk information, etc. to filter out stop words and restrict candidate terms to predefined syntactic patterns <cite>, <cite>.. </t>
<t>while this observation confirms <cite>, the impact of error reduction is much less than reported there for english about ##  <cite>.. </t>
<t>it proves that such consensus translations are usually better than the output of individual systems <cite>.. </t>
<t>to prepare this corpus for analysis, we extracted the body text from each of the #.# million entries in the corpus and applied a maximum entropy algorithm to identify sentence boundaries <cite>.. </t>
<t>for english texts, these trees were first provided by the connexor parser at <cite>, and then corrected by one of the team pis.. </t>
<t>that could best deal with the free word order displayed by <cite>.. </t>
<t>our chunk based system takes the last word of the chunk as its head word for the purposes of predicting roles, but does not make use of the identities of the chunk s other words or the intervening words between a chunk and the predicate, unlike hidden markov model like systems such as <cite>, <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> use hand written rules and knowledge bases to classify proper names into broad categories.. </t>
<t>the top ranked candidateis selected for presentation and verbalized using a language model interfaced with <cite>, a text generation engine.. </t>
<t>several substantial resources exist  e.g., hand crafted large scale grammars like the english resource grammar (erg <cite>) and the dutch <cite>. unfortunately, the construction of these resources is the manual result of human efforts and therefore likely to contain errors of omission and commission <cite>.. </t>
<t>on the other hand, in the framework of bilingual term correspondences estimation of this paper, the computational complexity of enumerating translation candidates can be easily avoided with the help of cross language retrieval of relevant news texts. furthermore, unlike <cite>, bilingual term correspondences for compound terms are not restricted to compositional translation.. </t>
<t><cite> compared three commonly used methods for named entity recognition the svm with quadratic kernel, maximal entropy method, and a rule based learning system, and showed that the svm based system performed better than the other two.. </t>
<t>in the context of graph based clustering of words, <cite> used a graph model for unsupervised lexical acquisition.. </t>
<t>nlp researchers have developed many algorithms for mining knowledge from text and the web, including facts <cite>, semantic lexicons <cite>, concept lists <cite>, and word similarity lists <cite>.. </t>
<t>after analyzing the dependency structure of sentences in penn chinese <cite>, we found an interesting phenomenon  if we define a main root as the head of a sentence, and define a subsentence as a sequence of words separated by punctuations, and the head# of these words is the child of main root or main root itself, then the punctuations that depend on main root can be a separator of sub sentences.. </t>
<t>with the increasing popularity of statistical nlp, <cite>, <cite> and <cite> used supervised learning for question classification on a data set from uiuc that is now standard#.. </t>
<t>we built a parser based on the deterministic algorithm of <cite> as a base dependency parser.. </t>
<t><cite> is a probabilistic context free parser using bit vector operations <cite>.. </t>
<t>the ccg parsing consists of two phases  first the supertagger assigns the most probable categories toeach word, and then the small number of combinatory rules, plus the type changing and punctuation rules, are used with the cky algorithm to build a packed chart. we use the method described in clark and <cite> for integrating the supertagger with the parser  initially a small number of categories is assigned to each word, and more categories are requested if the parser can not find a spanning analysis.. </t>
<t>levenshtein distance has been used in natural language processing field as a component in the variety of tasks, including semantic role labeling <cite>, construction of the paraphrase corpora <cite>, evaluation of machine translation output <cite>, and others.. </t>
<t><cite> and <cite> introduce information retrieval method for language model adaptation.. </t>
<t>in <cite>, we proposed a framework that automatically evaluated automatic mt evaluation metrics using only manual translations without further human involvement.. </t>
<t><cite> compared unsupervised hmm and transformation based taggers trained on the same portions of the penn treebank, and showed that the quality of the lexicon used for training had a high impact on the tagging results. <cite> presented a minimally supervised approach to tagging for dialectal arabic (colloquial egyptian), based on a morphological analyzer for modern standard arabic and unlabeled texts in a number of dialects.. </t>
<t>work by <cite> first used this framework for chinese word segmentation by treating it as a binary decision task, such that each character is labeled either as the beginning of a word or the continuation of one.. </t>
<t><cite> reduce the depth of the linguistic data used but still requires pos tagging. many papers directly target specific applications, and build lexical resources as a side effect. named entity recognition can be viewed as an in stance of our problem where the desired categories contain words that are names of entities of a particular kind, as done in <cite> using co clustering.. </t>
<t>our notion of entailment is ### based on the concept of distributional generality <cite>, a generalisation of the distributional hypothesis of <cite>, in which it is assumed that terms with a more general meaning will occur in a wider array of contexts, an idea later developed by <cite>.. </t>
<t>for evaluation the parser returns dependency structures, but we have also developed a module which builds first order semantic representations from the derivations, which can be used for inference <cite>.. </t>
<t>this basic architecture was introduced by <cite> for the task of semantic role labelling and since then has been applied to different nlp tasks without significant changes.. </t>
<t>in separate qualitative experiments done by <cite>, ## <cite> and <cite>, the agreement between human judges when given a list of sentiment bearing words is as low as ##  and no higher than ## .. </t>
<t>moreover, models developed for sentence compression have been mostly designed with one rewrite operation in mind, namely word deletion, and are thus unable to model consistent syntactic effects such as reordering, sentence splitting, changes in non terminal categories, and lexical substitution <cite>.. </t>
<t>t  amp  c##, de <cite> and <cite> describe very similar preposition error detection systems in which a model of correct prepositional usage is trained from well formed text and a writer s preposition is compared with the predictions of this model.. </t>
<t>the decision tree uses different context features for the prediction of different attributes <cite>.. </t>
<t>since we acquire verb entailment pairs based on unary templates <cite> we used the lin formula to acquire unary templates directly rather than using the dirt formula, which is the arithmetic geometric mean of lin s similarities for two slots in a binary template.. </t>
<t>the accuracy of the choice classifier, the part of the system to which the work at hand is most similar, is ##.##  when tested on text from encarta and reuters news. tetreault and <cite> present a system for detecting preposition errors in learner text.. </t>
<t><cite> presents a general approach for classifying word pairs into semantic relations by extracting the strings occurring between the two words of a pair (up to three words in between, up to one word on either side) and using a frequency based selection process to select sub patterns where words from the extracted context pattern may have been replaced by a wild card.. </t>
<t>our system not only out performs the best single system <cite> by #.# , but it also tops the ensemble system that combines three powerful parsers  the <cite>, the easy <cite> and the <cite> impact of sampling methods we compare two sampling methods introduced in section #.# with respect to their decoding efficiency.. </t>
<t>we follow <cite> and <cite> in proposing that sentence simplification can be approached as a monolingual machine translation task, where the source and target languages are the same and where the output should be simpler in form from the input but similar in meaning.. </t>
<t>the size of our hand labeled data allows us to perform cross validation experiments and check for the variance in performance of the classifier across folds. another significant effort for sentiment classification on twitter data is by <cite>.. </t>
<t>evaluation is performed on several datasets of tweets that have been annotated for polarity  the stanford twitter <cite>, <cite> use ## emoticons and ## twitter hash tags as proxies for sentiment in a similar manner, but their evaluation is indirect.. </t>
<t>higher order versions of categorial grammars like the ones being produced in the cug ucg frameworks.. </t>
<t>since the model estimation has been reduced to simple update calculations, the proposed model is similar to conventional spreading activation approaches, which have been applied, for example, to word sense disambiguation <cite>.. </t>
<t>the states could be more refined than those shown above  the state for the subject, for example, should probably be not np but a pair (npl, np#s) .stsg is simply a version of synchronous tree adjoining grammar or <cite> that lacks the adjunction operation.. </t>
<t>in general, the word segmentation program utilizes the word entries, part of speech (pos) information <cite> in a monolingual dictionary, segmentation rules <cite>, and some statistical information <cite>.. </t>
<t>in recent years, the statistical parsing community has begun to reach out  for syntactic formalisms that recognize the individuality of words, link grammars <cite> and lexicalized tree adjoining grammars <cite> have now received stochastic treatments.. </t>
<t>for the co occurrence model, we used <cite>, a broad coverage parser, to parse each data set.. </t>
<t>however, <cite> point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as chinese and english.. </t>
<t>this technique has previously been used not only for part of speech tagging <cite>, but also for prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation <cite>, and assigning unlabeled binary branching tree structure to sentences <cite>.. </t>
<t>more recently, <cite> propose an algorithm for anaphora resolution that is actually a modified and extended version of the one developed by <cite>.. </t>
<t>while classical approaches for word alignment are based on generative models (e.g., <cite> and <cite>), word alignment can also be viewed as a matching problem, where each word pair is associated with a score reflecting the desirability of aligning that pair, and the alignment is then the highest scored matching under some constraints.. </t>
<t>the state of the art in semantic role labelling has now advanced so much that a number of studies have shown that automatically inferred semantic argument structures can lead to tangible performance gains in nlp applications such as information extraction <cite>, question answering <cite> or recognising textual entailment <cite>.. </t>
<t>more recently, <cite> explored the use a formalism called quasi synchronous grammar <cite> in order to find a more explicit model for matching the set of dependencies, and yet still allow for looseness in the matching.. </t>
<t>current work in machine translation has shown that word sense disambiguation can play an important role by using the surrounding words as context to disambiguate terms <cite> <cite>.. </t>
<t>the overall pos tag distribution learnt by em is relatively uniform, as noted by <cite>, and it tends to assign equal number of tokens to each tag label whereas the real tag distribution is highly skewed.. </t>
<t>homogeneity refers to the degree that each cluster consists of data points primarily belonging to a single gs class, while completeness refers to the degree that each gs class consists of data points primarily assigned to a single cluster <cite>.. </t>
<t>as can be seen from the table, our approach with the weighted overlap signature comparison improves over the similar approach of <cite> which, however, does not involve the disambiguation step and considers a word as a whole unit as represented by the set of its senses.. </t>
<t>in order to provide an initial starting point, we initialize the weight vector using a similar procedure to the one used in <cite> to set weights for three features and a bias term.. </t>
<t>however, in all these cases the effective size of the state space (i.e., the number of sub symbols in the infinite <cite>, or the number of adapted productions in the adaptor grammar <cite>) was not very large.. </t>
<t>furthermore, when the upst (fpt) kernel is combined with a linear state of the state feature based kernel <cite> into a composite one via polynomial interpolation in a setting similar to <cite> (i.e. polynomial degree d # and coefficient?  #.#), we get the so far best performance of ##.# in f measure for #relation types on the ace rdc #### data set.. </t>
<t>there are two reasons why the syntactic reordering approach improves over the baseline phrase based <cite>.. </t>
<t>the learning algorithm we use to achieve this goal is motivated by discriminative training for machine translation systems <cite>, and extended to use large margin training in an online frame work <cite>.. </t>
<t>in the case of language models, we often have to remove low frequency words because of a lack of computational resources, since the feature space of k grams tends to be so large that we sometimes need cutoffs even in a distributed environment <cite>.. </t>
<t>we also construct a hebrew to english mt system using moses  factored translation model <cite>.. </t>
<t>the organizers of the conll #### shared task noted that languages with free word order and high morphological complexity are the most difficult for dependency parsing <cite>.. </t>
<t>system for english described in <cite> was used as a baseline, and then optimized for this new task, focusing on feature selection.. </t>
<t>the second order algorithm of <cite> uses in addition to <cite> the child of the dependent occurring in the sentence between the head and the dependent as well as the edge from the dependents to a grandchild.. </t>
<t><cite> reduced the phrase table based on the significance testing of phrase pair co occurrence in bilingual corpus.. </t>
<t>the hierarchical phrase base translation grammar was extracted using a suffix array rule extractor <cite>.. </t>
<t>boyd <cite> describe a related topic model, ldawn, for word sense disambiguation that adds an intermediate layer of latent variables z on which the markov model parameters are conditioned.. </t>
<t>the best performing (closed class) system in the domain adaptation track used a combination of co learning and active learning by training two different parsers on the labeled training data, parsing the unlabeled domain data with both parsers, and adding parsed sentences to the training data only if the two parsers agreed on their analysis <cite>.. </t>
<t>we also analyze the labeled corpus for opinion expressions and observe that many opinion expressions are used in multiple domains, which is identical with the conclusion presented by <cite>.. </t>
<t>the baselines include a pair wise hypothesis alignment approach using the indirect hmm (ihmm) proposed by <cite>, and an incremental hypothesis alignment approach using the incremental hmm (inchmm) proposed by <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> propose a method based on machine translation to generate parallel texts, followed by a cross lingual projection of subjectivity labels, which are used to train subjectivity annotation tools for romanian and spanish.. </t>
<t>to experiment with this combined model we use loopy belief propagation <cite>, previously applied to dependency parsing by <cite>.. </t>
<t>nevertheless, recent works in the nlp community investigating the impact of entity grids <cite> or of discourse relations <cite> on text coherence and readability go in the same direction as research on coh metrix, in that they aim at identifying the linguistic features that best express readability at syntactic, semantic and discourse level.. </t>
<t>following <cite>, we refine selection by requiring both the original phrase and paraphrase to be of the same syntactic type, which leads to more grammatical paraphrases.. </t>
<t>finally, to calculate rule feature probabilities for our model, we need to calculate the fractional counts <cite> of each translation rule in a parse forest.. </t>
<t>for example, the features introduced by <cite> and <cite> for an scfg model for chinese english translation are of two types  the first type explicitly counters overestimates of rule counts, or rules with bad overlap points, bad rewrites, or with undesired insertions of target side terminals.. </t>
<t>previous studies using this on line task marketplace have shown that the collective judgments of many workers are comparable to those of trained annotators on labeling tasks <cite> although these judgments can be obtained at a fraction of the cost and effort.. </t>
<t>inaddition, the architecture and system components of reconcile (including a comprehensive set of features that draw on the expertise of state of the art supervised learning approaches, such as <cite>) result in performance closer to the state of the art.. </t>
<t>the second baseline is a pipeline approach (pipeline), where we first segment the lecture transcript with <cite> and then use the pairwise alignment to find their best alignment to the segments of the story.. </t>
<t>to further gain insight into how successful current models are at disambiguating when they have the power to do so, we examined a collection of <cite> and asked how the accuracy scores would change if, after training was completed, the model were forced to assign the same label to all tokens of the same type.. </t>
<t>to show that the influence of punctuations on parsing is independent of specific parsing algorithms, we conduct experiments using three parsers, each representing a different parsing methodology  the open source mst <cite>, our own re implementation of an arc standard transition based parser <cite>, which is trained using global learning and beam search <cite> with a rich feature set <cite>, and our own re implementation of the easy first parser <cite> with an extended feature set <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> proposed a linear approximation to bleu score (log bleu) as a new loss function in mbr decoding and extended it from n best lists to lattices, and <cite> presented more efficient algorithms for mbr decoding on both lattices and hyper graphs to alleviate the high computational cost problem in tromble et al s work.. </t>
<t><cite> use an unsupervised technique based on joint inference across mentions and markov logic as a representation language for their system on both muc and ace data.. </t>
<t>weights on feature functions are found by lattice <cite>.. </t>
<t>a novel grammar induction algorithm  to automatically induce such synchronous grammar rules, we propose a novel generative model that establishes phrasal correspondences between logical sub expressions and natural language word sequences, by extending a previous model proposed for parsing natural language into meaning representations <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite>, for example, propose an algorithm for phrase based sentiment analysis that learns proper assignments of intermediate sentiment analysis decision variables given the a priori (i.e., out of context) polarity of the words in the phrase and the (correct) phrase level polarity.. </t>
<t>all differences between de annotated and baseline are significant at the level of #.## with the approximate randomization test in <cite> conduct additional experiments with a hierarchical phrase reordering model introduced by <cite>.. </t>
<t>in addition, our english parsing results are better than those of the <cite> bilingual reranker, the current top performing english chinesebilingual parser, despite ours using a much simpler set of synchronization features.. </t>
<t>following <cite>, we consider a semantic parsing setting where the goal is to (#) decompose the syntactic dependency tree of a sentence into fragments, (#) assign each of these fragments to a cluster of semantically equivalent syntactic structures, and (#) predict predicate argument relations between the fragments.. </t>
<t>values that can be computed using the semirings include the number of derivations, the expected translation length, the entropy of the translation posterior distribution, and the expected values of feature functions <cite>.. </t>
<t>l <cite> extends standard lda to include supervision for specific target categories, yet in a different way  (i) the generative process includes a second observed variable, i.e. each document is explicitly labeled with a target category.. </t>
<t>over the last several of years, mechanical turk, introduced by amazon as  artificial artificial intelligence , has been used successfully for a number of nlp tasks, including robust evaluation of machine translation systems by reading comprehension <cite>, and other tasks explored in the recent naacl workshop <cite>.. </t>
<t>although large amounts of unlabeled data are known to improve semi supervised parsing <cite>, the best unsupervised systems use less data than is available for supervised training, relying on complex models instead  <cite> extended valence grammar (evg) combats data sparsity with smoothing alone, training on the same small subset of the tree bank as the classic implementation of the dmv  <cite> use more complicated algorithms (variational em and mbrdecoding) and stronger linguistic hints (tying related parts of speech and syntactically similar bilingual data).. </t>
<t>indeed, the qg formalism has been previously applied to parser adaptation and projection <cite>, paraphrase identification <cite>, question answering <cite>, and title generation <cite>.. </t>
<t>to train a polylingual topic model on social media, we make two modifications to the model of <cite>  add a token specific language variable, and a process for identifying aligned top ics.. </t>
<t>as mentioned above, <cite> report that seed set composition affects the correctness of the harvested instances, and <cite> observe an increment of ##  precision and ##  recall between the best and worst performing seed sets for the task of entity set expansion.. </t>
<t>the cluster ranking model of <cite> proceeds in a left to right fashion and adds the current discourse old mention to the highest scoring preceding cluster.. </t>
<t>we start by preprocessing all the news in the news collections with a standard nlp pipeline  tokenization and sentence boundary detection <cite>, part of speech tagging, dependency parsing <cite>, coreference resolution <cite> and entity linking based on wikipedia and freebase.. </t>
<t>table # lists the results, where huang #### refers to the result of <cite>, chen####bi refers to the result of using bilingual features in <cite>, and chen####all refers to the result of using all of the features in <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> proposed a phrase level dependency parsing for mining aspects and features of products.. </t>
<t>in nlp, <cite> and <cite> applied dual decomposition to enforce agreement between different sentence level algorithms for parsing and pos tagging.. </t>
<t>in addition to the basic approach of concatenation of in domain and out of domain data, we also trained a log linear mixture model <cite> as well as the linear mixture model of <cite> for conditional phrase pair probabilities over in and out.. </t>
<t>our multi sieve approach is different from <cite> in several respects  (a) our sieves are machine learning classifiers, (b) the same pair of mentions can fall into multiple sieves, (c) later sieves can override the decisions made by earlier sieves, allowing to recover from errors as additional evidence becomes available.. </t>
<t>interestingly, recent approaches to the semantic composition of adjectives with nouns such as <cite> and <cite> draw on the classical analysis of adjectives within the montagovian tradition of formal semantic theory <cite>, on which they are treated as higher order predicates, and model adjectives as matrices of weights that are applied to noun vectors.. </t>
<t>here we review the splitting procedure of <cite> that is used to generate ccg lexical items and describe how it is used by t to create a packed chart representation of all parses  t  that are consistent with s and at least one of the meaning representations in  m .. </t>
<t>we compare to the following three systems that do not augment the tree banks and report results for some of the languages that we considered  usr  the weakly supervised system of <cite>, in which manually defined universal syntactic rules (usr) are used to constrain a probabilistic bayesian model.. </t>
<t><cite> use a latent variable model to predict geolocation information of twitter users, and investigate geographic variations of language use.. </t>
<t>for projective parsing, dynamic programming for this factorization was derived in <cite> (model # in that paper), and for non projective parsing, dual decomposition was used for this factorization in <cite>.. </t>
<t>the first variable we consider is whether we have access to a small number of target language trees or only pre existing tree banks in a number of other languages  while not our actual target language, these other tree banks can still serve as a kind of proxy for learning which features generally transfer useful in formation <cite>.. </t>
<t>we should emphasize that the features induced from the addressee s utterance are unique to this task and are hardly available in the related tasks that predicted the emotion of a reader of news articles <cite> or personal stories <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> proposed a bilingual cross entropy difference to select data from parallel corpus for domain adaptation which captures the contextual information slightly, and outperformed monolingual cross entropy difference <cite>, which first shows the advantage of bilingual data selection.. </t>
<t>in our first experiment we used the english german portion of the clte corpus described in <cite>, consisting of ### multi directional entailment pairs which we equally divided into training and test sets.. </t>
<t><cite> introduced the method of pairwise ranking optimization (pro), which casts the problem of tuning as a ranking problem between pairs of translation candidates.. </t>
<t>furthermore, the success of both of these methods relative to the others examined in table # shows that it is the extra information provided in the matrix (rather than just the diagonal, representing the lexical vector) that encodes the relational nature of transitive verbs, thereby validating in part the requirement suggested in <cite> and <cite> that relational word vectors live in a space the dimensionality of which be a function of the arity of the relation.. </t>
<t>we have also used a named entity tagger trained specifically on the <cite> to directly extract named entities from tweets.. </t>
<t>we compare ollie to two state of the art open ie systems  (#) <cite>, which uses shallow syntactic processing to identify relation phrases that begin with a verb and occur between the argument phrases  # (#) <cite>, which uses bootstrapping from entries in wikipedia info boxes to learn extraction pat terns in dependency parses.. </t>
<t>our result stands in contrast with <cite>, the only study we are aware of that compared a sophisticated composition model <cite> to add and mult on realistic sentences, which attained the top performance with the simple models for both figures of merit they used.. </t>
<t>in parsing, <cite> and <cite> propose a model for joint morphological analysis, part of speech tagging and dependency parsing using a usingeval.pl from <cite>.. </t>
<t>goodman s transform, in combination with a range of heuristics, allowed <cite> to run the dop model on the penn treebank wsj benchmark and obtain some of the best results obtained with a generative model.. </t>
<t><cite> reported some degradation using a lexicalized tree adjoining grammar parser and minor improvement using collins lexicalized pcfg parser  however, this gain was obtained only when the parser was trained on a small labeled set.. </t>
<t>in this paper we show that for the tagger of <cite> such a method provides mediocre results (table #) even when the training criterion (likelihood or data probability for this tagger) is evaluated on the test set.. </t>
<t>our implementation of sextant uses a maximum entropy pos tagger designed to be very efficient, tagging at around ### ### words per second <cite>, trained on the entire penn <cite>.. </t>
<t>compound splitting as described in <cite> is applied to the german part of the corpus for the german to english system to reduce the out of vocabulary problem for german compound words.. </t>
<t>based on the aforementioned resources of information, we follow the method presented in <cite> to build a dictionary called vidic.. </t>
<t><cite> computes consensus translation by voting on a confusion network, which is created by pairwise word alignment of multiple baseline mt hypotheses.. </t>
<t>to show that the influence of punctuations on parsing is independent of specific parsing algorithms, we conduct experiments using three parsers, each representing a different parsing methodology  the open source mst <cite>, our own re implementation of an arc standard transition based parser <cite>, which is trained using global learning and beam search <cite> with a rich feature set <cite>, and our own re implementation of the easy first parser <cite> with an extended feature set <cite>.. </t>
<t>for classification we applied the updated tree kernel package <cite>, distributed with the svm light tool <cite> for learning support vector machines (svms).. </t>
<t><cite> also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral.. </t>
<t>since sentiment bearing words in english have different degree of centrality to the category of sentiment, we have constructed a measure of word centrality to the category of positive or negative sentiment described in our earlier work <cite>.. </t>
<t>other lexical similarity based automatic mt evaluation metrics, like <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, and <cite>, also perform well in capturing translation fluency, but share the same problem that although evaluation with these metrics can be done very quickly at low cost, their underlying assumption that a good translation is one that shares the same lexical choices as the reference translation is not justified semantically.. </t>
<t>callison <cite> report that bleu and nist favour n gram based mt models such as <cite>, so the translations produced by rule based systems score lower on the automatic evaluation, even though human judges consistently rate their output higher than pharaoh s translation.. </t>
<t>the same framework can be readily adapted to other compression models that are efficiently decodable, such as the semi markov model of <cite>, which would allow incorporating a language model for the compression.. </t>
<t>while it is found that bleu and nist correlate quite well with human judgments in evaluating <cite>, it is best to support these figures with human evaluation, which we did on a small scale.. </t>
<t><cite> model literal vs. non literal classification as a word sense disambiguation task and use a clustering algorithm which compares test instances to two automatically constructed seed sets (one with literal and one with non literal expressions), assigning the label of the closest set.. </t>
<t>in a previous study <cite>, the authors came up with a dozen possible syntactic forms for verb object pairs (based on passivization, determiner, and object pluralization) and used a corpus based statistical measure to determine the canonical form (s).. </t>
<t>on the lll data set, the la method using distributional similarity measures significantly outperforms both baselines and also yields better results than an approach based on shallow linguistic information <cite>.. </t>
<t>the intuition is that distributional evidence is able to cover the gap between word oriented usages of the ppr as for the pprw#w defined in <cite>, and its sentence oriented counterpart.. </t>
<t>in their work, they model the target word instances as samples from a multinomial distribution over senses which are successively characterized as distributions over words <cite>.. </t>
<t>one early approach, suggested by <cite> and later pursued in different variants by <cite> among others, was to, instead of modeling morphology along the more traditional finite state transducer, modeling it with a n tape automaton, where tapes would carry precisely this interleaving that is called for in semitic interdigitation.. </t>
<t>the original publications on datr sought to provide the language with (#) a formal theory of inference <cite> and (#) a model theoretic semantics <cite>.. </t>
<t>we have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in kaplan et al #### can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins.. </t>
<t>since many tagging systems utilise gazetteers of known entities, some research has focused on their automatic extraction from the web <cite> or <cite>, although <cite> and others have shown that larger ne lists do not necessarily correspond to increased ner performance.. </t>
<t>this is the shared task baseline system for the #### naacl hlt workshop on statistical machine translation <cite> and consists of the <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, mkcls <cite>, carmel,# and a phrase model training code.. </t>
<t>from now on, we shall refer to the chunk tag of a word as its iob value (iob was named by tjong kim sang and jorn <cite> after <cite>).. </t>
<t>following the timely emphasis on end to end evaluation, the official track used predicted mentions and measured performance using five coreference measures  <cite>, b # <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, and <cite>.. </t>
<t>for parameter optimization for the word alignment task, taskar, <cite> used a large margin approach by factoring the structure level constraints to constraints at the level of an alignment link.. </t>
<t>as in our previous work <cite>, we train two models we call stage # and stage #, both in the form of a weighted linear combination of feature values extracted from a pair of sentences and a proposed word alignment of them.. </t>
<t>we experimented with two different supervised aligners  a maximum entropy aligner <cite> and an improved correction model that corrects the maximum entropy alignments <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> show that exact fst decoding is feasible for a phrase based system with limited reordering (the <cite>), and de <cite> show that exact fst decoding is feasible for a specific class of hierarchical grammars (shallow # grammars).. </t>
<t><cite>, popescu and etzioni not only analyzed polarity of opinions regarding product features but also ranked opinions based on their strength.. </t>
<t><cite> present a two step process to recognize contextual polarity that employs machine learning and a variety of features.. </t>
<t><cite> and <cite> explore conditional random fields, <cite> examine different combinations of convolution kernels, while <cite> present a re ranking approach modeling complex relations between multiple opinions in a sentence.. </t>
<t>recent results on the sports and finance gold standard dataset <cite> show that domain wsd can achieve accuracy in the ## ##  ballpark when a state of the art algorithm such as personalized pagerank is paired with a distributional approach <cite> or with semantic model vectors acquired for many domains <cite>.. </t>
<t>in order to produce pos based surprisal estimates, versions of both the training and experimental texts with their words replaced by pos were developed  the bnc sentences were parsed by the stanford parser, version #.#.# <cite>, whilst the experimental texts were tagged by an automatic tagger <cite>, with posterior review and correction by hand following the penn treebank project <cite>.. </t>
<t>the standard approach to framing dependency parsing as an integer linear program was introduced by <cite>, who converted the mst parser of <cite> to use ilp for inference. the key idea is to build a complete graph consisting of tokens of the sentence where each edge is weighted by a learned scoring function.. </t>
<t>the second is the frequency with which the character is associated with emotional language   their emotional trajectory <cite>.. </t>
<t>however, this method does not work for realworld datasets such as <cite>, because of the knowledge bottleneck  it is often the case that the lack of sufficient linguistic knowledge causes failure of inference, thus the system outputs  no entailment  for almost all pairs <cite>.. </t>
<t>it has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest path between any two entities captures the information required to assert a relationship between them <cite>.. </t>
<t>the data sets for the coref task are produced based on three resources  medco coreference annotation <cite>, genia event annotation <cite>, and genia <cite>.. </t>
<t>the experiments of closed tests on the second <cite> show that the joint model significantly outperforms the baseline models of both generative and discriminative approaches.. </t>
<t>this character by character method was first proposed by <cite>, and a number of discriminative sequential learning algorithms have been exploited, including structured perceptron <cite>, the passive aggressive algorithm <cite>, conditional random fields (<cite>, and latent variable <cite>.. </t>
<t>note that this use of a host of language model features is substantially different from using a single language model score on hypothesized error and potential correction to filter out unlikely correction candidates as in <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> also presented a two level arranged word ordering and chunk ordering by a hierarchically organized collection of finite state transducers.. </t>
<t>with just this feature on a pair of word tokens (which depends only on their types), we can already make a stab at word alignment, aligning, say, each english word with the french word (or null) with the highest dice value (see <cite>), simply as a matching free heuristic mode.. </t>
<t>work in dialogue act tagging is also relevant, as it seeks to describe the actions and moves with which speakers display these types of positioning <cite>.. </t>
<t>this is in contrast to supervised word segmentation algorithms <cite>, which are typically used for segmenting text in documents written in languages that do not put spaces between their words like chinese.. </t>
<t><cite> describe heuristics for processing definite descriptions in news text.. </t>
<t>the core scheme is in principle identical with the muc coreference scheme and is restricted to the annotation of coreference in the sense of <cite>.. </t>
<t>obviously the program needs to be systematically tested on multiple lexica from different languages, but these results strongly suggest that it is possible to model the acquisition of morphology as a component of learning to generate language directly, rather than to treat computational learning as the acquisition of linguistic theory as several current approaches do, e.g. <cite>.. </t>
<t>this result is very similar to the ##.##  reported by van halteren, zavrel and <cite> who used the tnt trigram tagger <cite> on the same training and testing data.. </t>
<t>we implemented the perceptron approach with the same feature set as that of an existing generative model <cite>, and show that the perceptron model gives performance competitive to that of the generative model on parsing the penn treebank, thus demonstrating that an unnormalized discriminative parsing model can be applied with heuristic search.. </t>
<t>however, there has been no direct comparison of which knowledge sources are the most useful or whether combining a variety of knowledge sources, a strategy which has been shown to be successful for wsd in the general domain <cite>, improves results.. </t>
<t><cite> present a method for verb classification which relies only on distributional statistics taken from corpora in order to train a decision tree classifier to distinguish between three groups of intransitive verbs.. </t>
<t>distance features are important for a system that makes links based on the best pairwise coreference value rather than implicitly incorporating distance by linking only the closest pair whose score is above a threshold, as done by e.g. <cite>.. </t>
<t>pevzner and <cite> identified that pk  i) penalizes false negatives (fns)# more than false positives (fps)  ii) does not penalize full misses within k units of a reference boundary  iii) penalize near misses too harshly in some situations  and iv) is sensitive to internal segment size variance.. </t>
<t>the context sensitive extension <cite> is able to generate referring expressions for the most salient entity in a context  the boolean expressions algorithm <cite> is able to derive expressions containing boolean operators, as in the cup that does not have a handle  and the sets algorithm <cite> extends the basic approach to references to sets, as in the red cups.. </t>
<t>there is scope for experimenting with other approaches such as <cite>, however, we feel a type based approach is worthwhile to avoid the noise introduced from frequent but polysemous arguments and bias from highly frequent arguments which might be part of a multiword rather than a prototypical argument of the predicate in question, for example eat hat.. </t>
<t>the characteristics of x are  frame, frame evoking word, head word, content word <cite>, first last word, head word of left right sister, phrase type, position, voice, syntactic path (directed undirected partial), governing category <cite>, wordnet supersense in the phrase, combination features of frame evoking word  head word, combination features of frame evoking word  phrase type, and combination features of voice  phrase type.. </t>
<t>previous work on rhetorical analysis of scientific articles focus on either  #) hierarchical discourse relations between sentences <cite>, #) genre analysis within a descriptive framework <cite>, or #) zi in a flat structure and a statistical evaluation of the annotation scheme from a machine learning perspective <cite>.. </t>
<t>however, it is not clear that aer as defined by <cite> is always the appropriate way to evaluate the quality of the model, since the viterbi word alignment that aer is based on is seldom used in applications of model #.. </t>
<t>we are currently exploring whether <cite> graph based approach to gre is able to provide a better coverage of the data  this algorithm provides the ability to make use of different search strategies and weighting mechanisms when adding properties to a description, and such a mechanism might be used, for example, to counterbalance the relational algorithm s heavy bias towards the relations in this domain.. </t>
<t>the paper contains the following original contributions  #) the dp based decoding algorithm in <cite> is extended in a formal way to handle phrases and a novel pruning strategy with increased translation speed is presented #) a novel alignment algorithm is presented that computes a phrase alignment efficiently in the case that it is consistent with an underlying word alignment.. </t>
<t>in corpus linguistics building such mega corpora is beyond the scope of individual researchers, and they are not easily accessible <cite> unless the web is used as a corpus <cite>.. </t>
<t>approaches such as harvesting parallel corpora from the web <cite> address the creation of data.. </t>
<t>it is believed that the size of the web is thousands of times larger than normal large corpora, and the counts obtained from the web are highly correlated with the counts from large balanced corpora for predicate argument bi grams <cite>.. </t>
<t>for the experiments reported in this paper, we use as parser p, our in house implementation of the <cite>, to which various speed related enhancements <cite> have been applied.. </t>
<t>for example  <cite> use li and abe s method in a word sense disambiguation setting  schulteim <cite> use their mdl approach as part of a system for syntactic and semantic subcategorisation frame learning  <cite> deploys resnik s method for metaphor interpretation.. </t>
<t>previous work on automated metaphor detection includes <cite>, <cite>, and <cite>.. </t>
<t>we follow the notation of di <cite>.. </t>
<t>in addition, <cite> decompose german words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a maxent model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model.. </t>
<t>in contrast to the findings of <cite>), who addressed the broader task of subjectivity learning and found that the density of other potentially subjective cues in the context benefits classification accuracy, we observed that the co occurence of speculative cues in a sentence does not help in classifying a term as speculative or not.. </t>
<t>our baseline mt system is the alignment template system described in detail by och, tillmann, and <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>our best performing model incorporates three dimensions of parametrization and our best result <cite> is similar to the one obtained by the parser of <cite> for modern standard arabic <cite> using a fully lexicalized model and a training corpus about three times as large as our newest mh tree bank.. </t>
<t>of the many features that we have tried, one feature set stands out as being the most effective, the two level rules in <cite>, which give the number of times a given rule is used to expand a non terminal in a given parent rule.. </t>
<t>in contrast to these approaches, sentence fusion was introduced to combine fragments of sentences with common information for multi document summarization <cite>.. </t>
<t>based on this observation, dynamic programming <cite>, similarity measures such as <cite> or word and translation error ratios <cite>, or maximum entropy classifier <cite> are used for discovering parallel sentences.. </t>
<t><cite> describes a method (latent relational analysis) that extracts subsequence patterns for noun pairs from a large corpus, using query expansion to increase the recall of the search and feature selection and dimensionality reduction to reduce the complexity of the feature space.. </t>
<t><cite> introduce a hiero variant with relaxed constraints for hypothesis recombination during parsing  speed and results are comparable to those of cube pruning, as described by <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> is a corpus of ccg derivations that was semiautomatically converted from the wall street journal section of the penn treebank.. </t>
<t>the schemas were developed by manual inspection using section ## of ccgbank and the ptb as a development set, following the oracle methodology of <cite>, in which gold standard derivations from ccgbank are converted to the new representation and compared with the gold standard for that representation.. </t>
<t>we show that our multiple rank model outperforms b   l s basic model on two tasks, sentence ordering and summary coherence rating, evaluated on the same datasets as in <cite>.. </t>
<t>for training, we use the feature forest model <cite>, which was originally designed as an efficient algorithm for solving maximum entropy models for data with complex structures.. </t>
<t>these approaches have been shown to be successful for tasks such as parsing and named entity recognition in newswire data <cite> or semantic role labeling in the penn treebank and <cite>.. </t>
<t>transition based  an implementation of the transition based dependency parsing framework <cite> using an arc eager transition strategy and are trained using the perceptron algorithm as in <cite> with a beam size of #.. </t>
<t>as pointed out by <cite>, agreement doesn t ensure validity.. </t>
<t>features previously found to be useful for detecting phrase level contextual polarity <cite> are also included.. </t>
<t>the wide variety of techniques for acquiring phrasal paraphrases, which can subsequently be used by text paraphrasing techniques <cite>, the inherent polysemy of such linguistic units and the pragmatic constraints on their uses make it impossible to ensure that potential paraphrase pairs will be substitutable in any context, an observation which was already made at a lexical level <cite>.. </t>
<t>several approaches have investigated the above mentioned problem  <cite> use a representation based on third order tensors and provide a general framework for distributional semantics in which it is possible to represent several aspects of meaning using a single data structure.. </t>
<t>indirect speech acts are studied by <cite>, <cite>, <cite> and <cite>, who identify a wide range of factors that govern how speakers convey their intended messages and how hearers seek to uncover those messages from uncertain and conflicting signals.. </t>
<t>whereas head grammars provide for an account of verb fronting and cross serial dependencies, pereira, introducing extraposition grammars in <cite>, is focused on displacement of noun phrases in english.. </t>
<t>coordination ambiguity is under explored, despite being one of the three major sources of structural ambiguity (together with prepositional phrase attachment and noun compound bracketing), and belonging to the class of ambiguities for which the number of analyses is the number of binary trees over the corresponding nodes <cite>, and despite the fact that conjunctions are among the most frequent words.. </t>
<t>indeed, the collagen architecture, like that of the queen s communicator, manages discourse using a focus stack, a classical idea in the theory of discourse structure <cite>.. </t>
<t>we developed a set of augmented context free grammar rules for general english syntactic analysis and the analyzer is implemented using tomita lr parsing algorithm <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> presented an algorithm to generate quantifier scopings from a representation of predicate argument relations and the relations of grammatical subordination.. </t>
<t><cite> gives a more covering description of how xpost is used on the swedish material and also sketches the major differences between this algorithm and some others used for tagging, such as <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>each semantic predicate in verbnet also include a time function specifying whether the predicate is true in the preparatory (during (e)) ,culmination (end (e)), or consequent (result (e)) stage of an event, in a tripartite event structure is similar to that of <cite>, which allows us to express the semantics of classes of verbs like change of state verbs whose description requires reference to a complex event structure.. </t>
<t><cite> improved upon the above work by specifying rules for how events are related to one another in a discourse and sing and sing defined semantic constraints through which events can be related <cite>.. </t>
<t>we use pointwise mutual information (<cite> to measure the strength of the association between x and y, which is defined as follows pmi (x, y)  log (p (x, y) p (x) p (y)).. </t>
<t>in this sense, it is not unlike <cite> s semantic head driven generation.. </t>
<t><cite> described a two fold probabilistic approach to recognizing entailment, that in its turn was based on the well known noisy channel model from statistical machine <cite>.. </t>
<t>the idea of using lexical chains as indicators of lexical cohesion goes back to <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> developed a system called met , capable of discriminating between literalness, metonymy, metaphor and anomaly.. </t>
<t>corelex is based on a different theory than levin s (that of the generative lexicon <cite>), but does provide a compatible decompositional meaning representation for nouns.. </t>
<t>we propose a tagger that makes use of several types of information (dictionary definitions, parts of speech, domain codes, selectional preferences and collocates) in the tradition of <cite> although, the information sources we use are orthogonal, unlike the sources he used, making it easier to evaluate the performance of the various modules.. </t>
<t>the resulting n best hypotheses are processed by the tina language understanding component <cite>.. </t>
<t>on the other hand, the thesaurus based method of <cite> may suffer from loss of information (since it is semi class based) as well as data sparseness since h classes used in <cite> are based on the wordnet taxonomy while classes of <cite> and <cite> are derived from statistical data collected from corpora.. </t>
<t><cite> gave an example of a simple discourse.. </t>
<t>many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus <cite>.. </t>
<t>if, instead, this procedure returns a list of several possible actions with corresponding probabilities, we can then parse with a model similar to the probabilistic lr models described by <cite>, where the probability of a parse tree is the product of the probabilities of each of the actions taken in its derivation.. </t>
<t>the starting point is the log likelihood ratio <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> based their align program on the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.. </t>
<t>one of the earliest corpus based approaches to prepositional phrase attachment used lexical preference by computing co occurrence frequencies (lexical associations) of verbs and nouns with prepositions <cite>.. </t>
<t>word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal <cite>.. </t>
<t>in terms of practical mwe identification systems, a well known approach is that of <cite>, who uses a set of techniques based on statistical methods, calculated from word frequencies, to identify mwes in corpora.. </t>
<t>the foundational work of <cite> was based on plain text (#.# million words of the wall <cite>).. </t>
<t>the statistical machine translation framework (smt) formulates the problem of translating a sentence from a source language s into a target language t as the maximization problem of the conditional probability  tm lm  argmaxt p (s t) p (t), (#) where p (s t) is called a translation model (tm), rep resenting the generation probability from t into s, p (t) is called a language model (lm) and represents the likelihood of the target language <cite>.. </t>
<t>concerning relatedness measure, additional corpus based measures such as web basedmeasures <cite> or measures based on syntactic relations <cite> could appear to be useful for improving the ranking of the extracted relations.. </t>
<t><cite> examines unknown words in the context of part of speech tagging.. </t>
<t>empirical studies on the disambiguation of cue phrases <cite> have shown that just by considering the orthographic environment in which a discourse marker occurs, one can distinguish between sentential and discourse usages in about ##  of cases.. </t>
<t>the basic engine used to perform the tagging in these experiments is a direct descendent of the maximum entropy (me) tagger of <cite> which in turn is related to the taggers of <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>unlike arbitrary regularization, same length regular n relations are closed under intersection and complementation , because a theorem tells us that they correspond to regular languages over of symbols <cite>.. </t>
<t>we have crawled ### million web pages over three months, may july in ####, by using the shim crawler, and then converted these pages into web standard format data with results of a japanese parser, <cite>, through our conversion tools.. </t>
<t><cite> describe an algorithm for pronominal anaphora resolution that achieves a high rate of correct analyses <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> explicitly suggests performing word sense disambiguation in the target language (english in the article) with the goal of resolving ambiguity in the source language (hebrew).. </t>
<t>an additional complication with our construction is that finding any of the values in (#) may involve solving a system of non linear equations, similarly to the case of probabilistic context free grammars  see again <cite>, and <cite>.. </t>
<t>centering s rule # states that if any element of the previous utterance s forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well <cite>.. </t>
<t>tbl is a machine learning approach that has been employed to solve a number of problems in natural language processing  most famously, it has been used for part of speech tagging <cite>.. </t>
<t>aligning parallel text, i.e. automatically setting the sentences or words in one text into correspondence with their equivalents in a translation, is a very useful preprocessing step for a range of applications, including but not limited to machine translation <cite>, cross language information retrieval <cite>, dictionary creation <cite> and induction of <cite>.. </t>
<t>for local classifiers, we used a maximum entropy model which is a common choice for incorporating various types of features for classification problems in natural language processing <cite>.. </t>
<t>to test the reliability of the annotation, we first considered the kappa statistic <cite> which is used extensively in empirical studies of dis course <cite>.. </t>
<t>because segmentation using a dictionary alone can serve as a strong baseline in chinese word segmentation <cite>, the use of dictionaries is expected to make our joint model more robust and enables us to investigate the contribution of the syntactic dependency in a more realistic setting.. </t>
<t>the monologue side has been annotated with discourse relations, using an adaptation of the annotation guidelines of <cite>, whereas the dialogue side has been marked up with dialogue acts, using tags inspired by the schemes of <cite>, <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> approach is in line with the earlier texttiling method that identifies subtopic structure in text <cite>.. </t>
<t>automatic discourse segmentation, as shallow annotation of discourse structure, also provides a testing grounds for linguistic theories of discourse <cite> and provides a natural unit of measure in linguistic corpora <cite>.. </t>
<t>another very important and powerful strength of finite state transducers, they can be composed together to build a single transducer that can perform the same task that could be done with help of two or more transducers when applied sequentially <cite>, not only allows us to build a direct hindi urdu transducer, but also helps to divide difficult and complex problems into simple ones, and has indeed simplified the process of building the humt system.. </t>
<t>the empirical adequacy of synchronous context free grammars of rank two (# <cite>, used in syntax based machine translation systems such as <cite>.. </t>
<t>the possible part(s) of speech of unknown words <cite>.. </t>
<t>later, avg were enriched with a statistical component <cite>  stochastic avg (savg).. </t>
<t>a review of methods for word sense disambiguation is presented by ide and colleagues <cite>.. </t>
<t>inspired by the work of <cite>, tsweb was constructed using monosemous relatives from wn (synonyms ,hypernyms, direct and indirect hyponyms, and siblings), querying google and retrieving up to one thousand snippets per query (that is, a word sense), extracting the salient words with distinctive frequency using tfidf.. </t>
<t>the annotation scheme proposed by <cite> is a product of a corpus based analysis of definite description (dd) use showing that more than ##  of the dds in their corpus are discourse new or unfamiliar.. </t>
<t>the mdl based tree cut model was originally introduced for handling the problem of generalizing case frames using a thesaurus <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> article considers a number of different figures of merit for ordering the agenda, and ultimately recommends one that reduces the number of edges required for a full parse into the thousands.. </t>
<t>these include comparing templates filled in by extracting information using specialized, domain specific knowledge sources from the document, and then generating natural language summaries from the templates <cite>.. </t>
<t>phoneme based method <cite> makes use of phonetic correspondence to generate the transliteration.. </t>
<t>concerning the pcfg model, grammars, tree binarization and the different tree representations are created with our own scripts, while entity tree parsing is performed with the chart parsing algorithm described in <cite>.. </t>
<t>a few of the errors were genuine, and could be explained by failures of the sentence alignment program that was used to create the corpus <cite>.. </t>
<t>it was first introduced as a means of reducing parser ambiguity by <cite> in the context of the ltag formalism, and has since been applied in a similar context within the ccg formalism <cite>.. </t>
<t>thus the size of the annotated data <cite> compares favourably with the size of evaluation data in other proposals (### german pronouns in <cite>, #,### english pronouns in <cite>, about #,### english co referential expressions in <cite>) .in the experiments, systems only looked for single np antecedents.. </t>
<t><cite> augmented such logic programs with semiring weights, giving an algebraic explanation for the intuitive connections among classes of algorithms with the same logical structure.. </t>
<t>as already mentioned, the similarity between smt decoding and tsp was recognized in <cite>, who focussed on showing that any tsp can be reformulated as a sub class of the smt decoding problem, proving that smt decoding is np hard.. </t>
<t>the goal is not only to annotate the data, but also to compare the representation of these relations in the prague dependency treebank with the annotation done at the penn treebank, which was carried out at university of <cite>.. </t>
<t>other attempts to address efficiency include the fast transformation based learning (tbl) <cite> which dramatically speeds up training tbl systems, and the translation of tbl rules into finite state ma chines for very fast tagging.. </t>
<t>for example, motivated by the fact that some coreference relations are harder to identify than the others (see <cite>), ng and <cite> present a method for mining easy positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances that may complicate the acquisition of an accurate coreference model.. </t>
<t>this would not rule out the possibility that bigram presence is as equally useful a feature as unigram presence  in fact, <cite> found that bigrams alone can be effective features for word sense disambiguation.. </t>
<t>based on the convention from <cite> and <cite>, a disfluent spoken utterance is divided into three parts  the reparandum, the part that is repaired  the interregnum, which can be filler words or empty  and the repair repeat, the part that replaces or repeats the reparandum.. </t>
<t>similarly to <cite>, we show that languages are often close enough to others within their language family so that cognate pairs between the two are common, and significant portions of the translation lexicon can be induced with high accuracy where no bilingual dictionary or parallel corpora may exist.. </t>
<t>probably the best known measure of syntactic expectation is surprisal <cite> which can be coarsely defined as the negative log probability of word wt given the preceding words, typically computed using a probabilistic context free grammar.. </t>
<t>in natural language learning, co training was applied to statistical parsing <cite>, reference resolution <cite>, part of speech tagging <cite>, and others, and was generally found to bring improvement over the case when no additional unlabeled data are used.. </t>
<t>approaches to the induction of morphology as presented in e.g. <cite> or <cite> show that the morphological properties of a small subset of languages can be induced with high accuracy, most of the existing approaches are motivated by applied or engineering concerns, and thus make assumptions that are less cognitively plausible.. </t>
<t>with <cite> reported the best f score of ##.## with the voting of several models trained by support vec tor machine in the same experimental settings and with the same feature set.. </t>
<t>this can be seen as a rough approximation of <cite>.. </t>
<t>while word and phrasal paraphrases can be assimilated to the well studied notion of synonymy, sentence level paraphrasing is more difficult to grasp and can not be equated with word for word or phrase by phrase substitution since it might entail changes in the structure of the sentence <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite>, in the shared task we used only the simplest feed forward approximation, which replicates the computation of a neural network of the type proposed in <cite>.. </t>
<t>we intend to explore other methods for pruning the space and agenda based parsing, in particular a  parsing <cite>, which will allow only the most probable parts of the chart to be built, improving efficiency while still ensuring the optimal derivation is found.. </t>
<t>as for the smt system, we use a standard log linear pb <cite>  giza++ implementation of ibm word alignment model #, the refinement and phrase extraction heuristics described in <cite>, minimum error rate training <cite>, a # gram language model with kneser ney smoothing <cite> trained with <cite> on the english side of the training data, and <cite> to decode.. </t>
<t>in a recent study <cite>, we showed that the recall based unigram co occurrence automatic scoring metric correlates highly with human evaluation and has high recall and precision in predicting the statistical significance of results comparing with its human counter part.. </t>
<t>variations of scfgs go back to <cite> s syntax directed translation schemata, but also include the inversion transduction <cite>, which restrict grammar rules to be binary, the synchronous grammars in <cite>, which use only a single nonterminal symbol, and the multi text grammars in <cite>, which allow independent rewriting, as well as other tree based models such as <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>most of existing systems on the web produce a set of answers to a question in the form of hyper links or page extracts, ranked according to a relevance score <cite>.. </t>
<t>in a similar vein, <cite> used a corpus of alternative english translations of chinesenews stories in combination with a syntax based algorithm that automatically builds word lattices, in which paraphrases can be identified.. </t>
<t>the intrinsic evaluation measures used in our experiments are the well known <cite> and <cite> metrics, and an f score measure that adapts evaluation techniques from dependency based parsing <cite> and sentence condensation <cite> to machine translation.. </t>
<t>in recent years discriminative probabilistic model shave been successfully applied to a number of information extraction tasks in natural language processing (nlp), such as named entity recognition (<cite>, noun phrase chunking <cite>.. </t>
<t>within rhetorical structure theory (rst), <cite> have developed two probabilistic models for identifying clausal elementary discourse units and generating discourse trees at the sentence level.. </t>
<t>we also added part of speech (pos) tags to the data using the tagger of <cite>, and used the tags to decide if mentions were plural or singular.. </t>
<t>this work is related to several existing directions  generative factored language model, discriminative language models, online passive aggressive learning and confidence weighted learning. generative factored language models are proposed by <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> formulate a metric which measures translation accuracy in terms of precision and recall directly rather than precision and a brevity penalty.. </t>
<t>details of the mention detection and coreference system can be found in <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> compare the <cite> parser with the parc lfg parser by mapping lfg f structures and penn treebank parses into depbank dependencies, claiming that the lfg parser is considerably more accurate with only a slight reduction in speed.. </t>
<t><cite> described the use of tree transducers for natural language processing and addressed the training problems for this kind of transducers.. </t>
<t>to make a tool like the hmm work at higher levels, one needs to make stronger assumptions, for instance as signing each sentence a single topic and then topic specific word models can be used  the hidden topic <cite> that models the transitional topic structure  a global model based on the generalised <cite>, and a hmm based content model <cite>.. </t>
<t>more recently, <cite> showed that simple unsupervised models perform significantly better when the frequencies are obtained from the web, rather than from a large standard corpus.. </t>
<t>in evaluations of summarization algorithms, it is common practice to derive the gold standard con tent importance scores from human summaries, as done, for example, in the pyramid method, where the importance of a content element corresponds to the number of reference human summaries that make use of it <cite>.. </t>
<t>furthermore, at the #### johns hopkins summer workshop on statistical machine translation, a large number of features were tested to discover which ones could improve a state of the art translation system, and the only feature that produced a  truly significant improvement  was the <cite>.. </t>
<t>moses baseline  we trained a <cite> with the following settings  maximum sentence length ##, grow diag final and symmetrization of giza++ alignments, an interpolated kneserney smoothed # gram language model with <cite> used at runtime, msd bidirectional felexicalized reordering, sparse lexical and domain features <cite>, distortion limit of #, ### best translation options, minimum bayes risk decoding <cite>, cube pruning <cite> and the no reordering over punctuation heuristic.. </t>
<t>traditionally, n best rerankers <cite> have applied expensive analysis after the translation process, on both the source and target side, though they suffer from being limited to whatever is on the n best list <cite>.. </t>
<t>in some of the early works on statistical readability assessment, <cite> and collins <cite> reported the impact of using unigram language models to estimate the grade level of a given text.. </t>
<t>using this intuition, state of the art systems first build a parse tree, and syntactic constituents are then labeled by feeding hand built features extracted from the parse tree to a machine learning system, e.g. the <cite>.. </t>
<t>in the joint approach (figure #c), we perform segmentation and l#p prediction simultaneously by applying the monotone search algorithm developed for statistical machine translation <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> extract translation rules from a large parsed parallel corpus that extend in scope to tree fragments beyond a single node  we believe that adding such larger scale operations to the translation model is likely to significantly improve the performance of syntactically supervised alignment.. </t>
<t><cite> have proposed an algorithm for labeling semantic classes, which can be viewed as a form of cluster.. </t>
<t>in recent years, conditional random fields (<cite> have shown success on a number of natural language processing (nlp) tasks, including shallow parsing <cite>, named entity recognition <cite> and information extraction from research papers <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> augmented name tagging training data with hierarchical word clusters and encoded cluster membership in features for improving name tagging.. </t>
<t>we use the lesk (overlap) similarity as implemented by the wordnet  similarity package <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> only changes the word segmentation of the morphologically complex language (arabic) to induce morphological and syntactic symmetry between the parallel sentences.. </t>
<t>in addition to the translation model, eleven feature functions are combined  a target language model  four lexicon models  two lexicalized reordering models <cite> aiming at predicting the orientation of the next translation unit  a weak distance based distortion model  and finally a word bonus model and a tuple bonus model which compensate for the system preference for short translations.. </t>
<t><cite> propose solutions to word segmentation and pos tagging of arabic text.. </t>
<t>for example, according to callison <cite>, a smt system with a training corpus of ##,### words learned only ##  of the vocabulary  the same system learned about ##  with a training corpus of ###,### words  and even with a large training corpus of nearly ##,###,### words it only reached about ##  coverage of the source vocabulary.. </t>
<t>given the clause representation, we follow the idea similar to <cite>, and predict the entailment decision in two stages of processing  (#) an alignment model aligns terms in the hypothesis to terms in the conversation segment  and (#) an inference model predicts the entailment based on the alignment between the hypothesis and the conversation segment.. </t>
<t>we start with comparable corpora in english and tamil, similar in size to that used in <cite>, and using the english side of this corpora, first, we extract all the nes that occur more than a given threshold parameter, fe, using a standard ner tool.. </t>
<t><cite> propose agreement based learning, which jointly learns probabilities by maximizing a combination of likelihood and agreement between two directional models.. </t>
<t>a noteable exception in constituent based parsing is the work of <cite> who show that self training is possible if a reranker is used to inform the underlying parser.. </t>
<t>our baseline coreference system implements the standard machine learning approach to coreference resolution (see ng and <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, for instance), which consists of probabilistic classification and clustering, as described below.. </t>
<t>compared with its string based counterparts, tree based decoding is simpler and faster  there is no need for synchronous binarization <cite> and tree parsing generally runs in linear time <cite>.. </t>
<t>prior work in relation discovery <cite> has investigated the problem of finding relationships between different classes.. </t>
<t>for example, both <cite> and <cite> have demonstrated results better than ##.#  on the apartments task described above using only a list of ## highly discriminative features and the labels they indicate.. </t>
<t>in our previous work <cite>, semantic parsing is cast as a machine translation task, where an scfg is used to model the translation of an nl into a formal meaning representation language (mrl).. </t>
<t>in addition, to allow for the possibility of valid lexical differences between the translation and the references, we follow <cite> and <cite> in adding a number of paraphrases in the process of evaluation to raise the number of matches between the translation and the reference, leading to a higher score.. </t>
<t>other orthographic normalization schemes have been suggested for <cite>, but we observe negligible parsing performance differences between these and the simple scheme used in this evaluation.. </t>
<t>the corpus consists of texts of the wall street journal corpus, and is hand tagged with <cite>.. </t>
<t>in the second approach, combination of the three dependency parsers is done according to the maximum spanning tree combination scheme of <cite>, which results in high accuracy of surface dependencies.. </t>
<t>as we show, this combination of a pairwise model and strong features produces a #.# percentage point increase in b cubed f score over a complex model in the state of the art system by <cite>, although their system uses a complex, non pairwise model, computing features over partial clusters of mentions.. </t>
<t>hidden markov models (hmms), a special case of dbns, are a classical method for important nlp applications such as unsupervised part of speech tagging <cite> and grammar induction <cite> as well as for asr.. </t>
<t>rather than attempt to derive a new parse tree like <cite> and <cite>, we learn to safely remove a set of constituents in our parse tree based compression model while preserving grammatical structure and essential content.. </t>
<t>the system used in this paper is a variant of the one proposed in <cite>, which we now describe in detail.. </t>
<t><cite> defined the following object function for the joint anaphoricity and coreference determination problem.. </t>
<t>however, it has been observed that ratings for different aspects can be correlated <cite>, e.g., very negative opinion about room cleanliness is likely to result not only in a low rating for the aspect rooms, but also is very predictive of low ratings for the aspects service and dining.. </t>
<t>to explore this, we tested our model in conjunction with a recent l#p system that has been shown to predict phonemes with state of the art word accuracy <cite>.. </t>
<t>for this work, we have re implemented and enhanced the <cite> in several ways  (#) developed a new method to handle rare words in english and chinese  (#) developed a new model of unknown chinese words based on characters in the word  (#) increased robustness by adding adaptive modification of pruning thresholds and smoothing of word emission probabilities.. </t>
<t>context sensitive extensions of <cite> and <cite> focus on making dirt rules context sensitive by attaching appropriate semantic classes to the x and y slots of an inference rule.. </t>
<t><cite> considers the output from an open information extraction system <cite> and clusters predicates and arguments using string similarity and a combination of constraints.. </t>
<t>while our results are not competitive with the best corpus based methods, we can note that our current corpus is an order of magnitude smaller   # million sentences versus # million full wikipedia articles <cite> or ###mb versus #.# <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> further extended it by using a shared logistic normal prior which provided a new way to encode the knowledge that some pos tags are more similar than others.. </t>
<t>in future work we intend to study ways to bridge this gap by #) incorporating more sophisticated linguistically driven grammar rule sets to guide induction, #) lexicalizing the model, and #) combining our constraint based approach with richer unsupervised models (e.g., headden <cite>) to benefit from their complementary strengths.. </t>
<t>the situation might be improved by using a model that does a better job of both capturing the structure of the source and target sentences and their allowable reorderings, such as a syntactic tree to string system that uses contextually rich rewrite rules <cite>, or by making use of larger more fine grained feature sets <cite> that allow for better discrimination between hypotheses.. </t>
<t>following <cite> and <cite>, <cite> showed that when translating from english to japanese (and to other sov languages such as korean and turkish) applying reordering as a preprocessing step that manipulates a source sentence parse tree can significantly outperform state of the art phrase based and hierarchical machine translation systems.. </t>
<t>while in principle, increasing the number of rejuvenation steps and particles will make this gap smaller and smaller, we believe the existence of the gap to be interesting in its own right, suggesting a general difference in learning behaviour between batch and incremental learners, especially given the similar results in <cite>.. </t>
<t>in the same spirit, <cite> merged the syntactic annotations and the named entity annotations of the <cite> and trained a discriminative parsing model for the joint problem of syntactic parsing and named entity recognition.. </t>
<t>models that use more structure in the representation of documents have also been proposed for generating more coherent and less redundant summaries, such as <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>an extended version of the lattice approach that does not require the use (and existence) of monolingual segmentation tools was proposed in <cite> where a maximum entropy model is used to assign probabilities to the segmentations of an input word to generate diverse segmentation lattices from a single automatically learned model.. </t>
<t>recently, wu and <cite> also show that semantic roles help in statistical machine translation , capitalising on a study of the correspondence between english and chinese which indicates that ##  of roles transfer directly, for propbank style annotations.. </t>
<t>more recently, <cite> present a method that uses clustering to produce multiple sense specific vectors for each word.. </t>
<t>in contrast to <cite> and <cite> that use annotated data for training, the system is trained on native data, but the native data are transformed to be more like l# data through artificial article errors that mimic the error rates and error patterns of non native writers.. </t>
<t>under the block hmm, as utilized by <cite>, messages in a conversation flow according to a markov process, where the words of messages are generated according to language models associated with a state in a hidden markov model.. </t>
<t>the sequence of article edits can be used as training data for data driven nlp algorithms, such as vandalism detection <cite>, text summarization <cite>, sentence compression <cite>, unsupervised extraction of lexical simplifications <cite>, the expansion of textual entailment corpora <cite>, or assesing the trustworthiness of wikipedia articles <cite>.. </t>
<t>altogether, our final system produces the best numbers reported to date on end to end coreference resolution (with automatically detected system mentions) on multiple data sets <cite> and metrics (muc and b#), achieving significant improvements over the reconcile dt baseline and over the state of the art results of <cite>.. </t>
<t>while several recent works on dealing with large bilingual collections of texts, e.g. <cite>, seek for extracting parallel sentences from comparable corpora, we present paradocs, a system designed to recognize pairs of parallel documents in a (large) bilingual collection of texts.. </t>
<t>our system not only outperforms the best single system <cite> by #.# , but it also tops the ensemble system that combines three powerful parsers  the <cite>, the easy <cite> and the <cite>.. </t>
<t>examples include constructing polarity lexicons based on lexical graphs from <cite>, constructing polarity lexicons from web data <cite> and unsupervised part of speech tagging using label propagation <cite>.. </t>
<t>as baselines we use <cite>, pro, and the <cite> implementation of k best mira, which <cite> recently showed to work as well as online <cite> for feature rich models.. </t>
<t>recently, <cite> developed an algorithm for inducing cross lingual word clusters and proposed to use these clusters to enrich the feature space of direct transfer systems.. </t>
<t><cite> propose an alternative evaluation scheme which, along with other properties, overcomes this by operating in terms of tokens rather than character offsets.. </t>
<t>for ner, we use standard features, including pos tags (from the previous experiments), indicators for hyphens, digits, single quotes, upper lowercase, # character prefix and suffix information, and brown word cluster features # with #,#,#,## bit string prefixes estimated from a large <cite>.. </t>
<t>note however that, because of the way the task is framed, performance also depends on the size of the vocabulary to be searched  <cite> pick the nearest neighbour among vectors for #m words, <cite> among ###k words, and we among ###k words.. </t>
<t><cite> worked on news and introduced an annotation scheme for temporal expressions, and a method for using explicit temporal expressions to assign activity times to the entirety of an article.. </t>
<t>in their study on al for base noun phrase chunking, <cite> compare the costs of rule writing with (al driven) annotation to compile a base noun phrase chunker.. </t>
<t>the supervised morphological learner presented in <cite> modeled lemmatization as a word final stem change plus a suffix taken from a (possibly empty) list of potential suffixes.. </t>
<t><cite> present an improved error model for noisy channel spelling correction that goes beyond single insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions.. </t>
<t>our method for estimation of selection and ordering preferences is based on the technique described in <cite>.. </t>
<t>in order to assess the quality of the word alignment, we randomly selected from the training corpus ### sentences, and a manual gold standard alignment has been done with the criterion of sure and possible links, in order to compute alignment error rate (aer) as described in <cite> and widely used in literature, together with appropriately redefined recall and precision measures.. </t>
<t>they induce a probabilistic tree adjoining grammar from a training set algning frames and sentences using the grammar induction technique of <cite> and use a beam search that uses weighted features learned from the training data to rank alternative expansions at each step.. </t>
<t><cite> proposed a statistical approach based on framenet i data for annotation of semantic roles.. </t>
<t>template based questions and summary asking inquiries cover most of the classes of question complexity proposed in <cite>.. </t>
<t>in this paper we describe two techniques   surface features and paraphrases   that push the ideas of <cite> and <cite> farther, enabling the use of statistics gathered from very large corpora in an unsupervised manner.. </t>
<t><cite> and callison <cite> extracted paraphrases from monolingual parallel corpus where multiple translations were present for the same source.. </t>
<t>the current best performing models, in terms of wer, for the hub # corpus, are the models of <cite>, <cite> (applied to n best lists by <cite>), and the slm of <cite> (applied to n best lists by <cite>).. </t>
<t>otherwise, composition strictly follows the semantic operations of the algebra of <cite>  the composition rules only refer to the hook and slots of functors and arguments, to achieve the binding of argument variables and the encoding of scope constraints.. </t>
<t>we are aware of the fact that other measures of lexical association have been proposed (evert and krenn, ####, and mi values were computed using adam berger s trigger toolkit <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> compare translations obtained by a multi stack decoder and a greedy hill climbing algorithm against those produced by an optimal integer programming decoder that treats decoding as a variant of the traveling salesman problem.. </t>
<t>in more recent work, <cite> combine a statistical segmentation model with a graph search algorithm to find the segmentation with the maximum probability.. </t>
<t><cite> use a parser in the target language to train probabilities on a set of ### operations that transform a target parse tree into a source string.. </t>
<t><cite> gives a general em algorithm for parameter estimation in probabilistic finite state transducers.. </t>
<t>most approaches to automatic pattern generation have focused on precision, e.g., <cite> report results in the text retrieval conference (trec) question answering track, where extracting one text of a relation instance can be sufficient, rather than detecting all texts.. </t>
<t>at first glance, source coreference resolution appears equivalent to the task of noun phrase coreference resolution and therefore amenable to traditional coreference resolution techniques (e.g. <cite>, <cite>).. </t>
<t>a number of studies are related to the work we presented, most specifically work on parallel text based  information projection  for parsing <cite>, but also grammar induction work based on constituent distituent information <cite> and (language internal) alignment based learning <cite>.. </t>
<t>finally, it is not clear that their numbers are in fact comparable to those of dienes and dubey on parsed data because the metrics used are not quite equivalent, particularly for (np ) s  among other differences, unlike jijkoun and de rijke s metric (taken from <cite>), dienes and dubey s is sensitive to the string extent of the antecedent node, penalizing them if the parser makes attachment errors involving the antecedent even if the system recovered the long distance dependency itself correctly.. </t>
<t>the pronunciation variation model is used to generate multiple pronunciations for each canonical pronunciation in a pronouncing dictionary and these variations are used in the spelling correction approach developed by <cite>, which uses statistical models of spelling errors that consider both orthography and pronunciation.. </t>
<t>some other systems are frameworks for performing generic tasks in one area of focus such as <cite> and <cite> for natural language <cite> and <cite> for network analysis and visualization  and lemur for language modeling and information retrieval.. </t>
<t>this is in line with results in <cite>, who compare the effect of manual and automatic parsing on semantic predicate argument recognition.. </t>
<t><cite> presented an unsupervised method for wsd using the same type of resource.. </t>
<t>in contrast, tree kernels <cite> can be used to efficiently generate the huge space of tree fragments but, to generate the space of pairs of tree fragments, a new kernel function has to be defined.. </t>
<t>for our experiments, we used a stochastic parsing system for lfg that we trained on section ## ## of the upenn wall street journal treebank <cite> by discriminative estimation of a conditional maximum entropy model from partially labeled data (see <cite>).. </t>
<t>the remaining six entries were all fully automatic machine translation systems  in fact, they were all phrase based statistical machine translation system that had been trained on the same parallel corpus and most used bleu based minimum error rate training <cite> to optimize the weights of their log linear models  feature functions <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> presents a decoder for syntax based mt that uses so called phrasal translation units that correspond to blocks.. </t>
<t>to evaluate sentence automatically generated with taking consideration word concatenation into by using references varied among humans, various metrics using n gram precision and word accuracy have been proposed  word string precision <cite> for summarization through word extraction, <cite> for abstracts, and <cite> for machine translation.. </t>
<t>also, a wide coverage statistical parser which produces syntactic dependency structures for english is available for <cite>.. </t>
<t>the ccg grammar used by our system is read off the derivations in ccgbank, following <cite>, meaning that the ccg combinatory rules are encoded as rule instances, together with a number of additional rules which deal with punctuation and type changing.. </t>
<t>a bootstrapping approach using machine learning is a possible alternative that will be explored in the future <cite>.. </t>
<t>an unsupervised approach was proposed to recognize discourse relations in <cite>, which extracts discourse relations that hold between arbitrary spans of text making use of cue phrases.. </t>
<t>many mt models implicitly make the so called direct correspondence assumption (dca) as defined in <cite>.. </t>
<t>a spelling based model is described in <cite> that directly maps english letter sequences into arabic letter sequences with associated probability that are trained on a small english arabic name list without the need for english pronunciations.. </t>
<t>at phase level, <cite> presents a technique for inferring the orientation and intensity of a phrase according to its pmi ir statistical association with a set of strongly polarized seed words.. </t>
<t>in this paper, it is tackled by a named entity recognition component, as in <cite>, using the following name alias algorithm in the ascending order of complexity.. </t>
<t>we used a feature set which included the current, next, and previous word  the previous two tags  various capitalization and other features of the word being tagged (the full feature set is described in <cite>).. </t>
<t><cite> also propose a supervised algorithm that uses part of speech patterns and a large corpus to extract semantic relations for who is type questions.. </t>
<t>however, it is a daunting task for people to find out information they are interested in from such a huge number of news tweets, thus motivating us to conduct some kind of information extraction such as event mining, where srl plays a crucial role <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> have developed a noisy channel model for qa, which explains how a sentence containing an answer to a given question can be rewritten into that question through a sequence of stochastic operations.. </t>
<t>second, we replace the <cite> implementation of support vector machines (svms) with <cite> as our machine learning tool, for reasons of speed, at the cost of a slight decrease in accuracy.. </t>
<t>we first evaluate our induced verb classes on the test set created by <cite> (table # of their paper) which was created by considering verb polysemy on the basis of levin s classes and the lcs database <cite>.. </t>
<t>unlike other language pairs, the availability of japanese english parallel corpora is quite limited  the ntcir patent corpus <cite> of # million sentence pairs (the latest ntcir # version) for the patent domain and <cite> of ###k sentence pairs for the news domain.. </t>
<t>for the tts systems (one for each translation direction), the training set will be lexically aligned using giza++ and for the ttt system, its syntactic trees will be aligned using techniques similar to the ones proposed by <cite> and by <cite>.. </t>
<t>finally, inspired by these intuitive notions of translational correspondence, <cite> include dependency features in a word alignment model to improve non syntactic baseline systems.. </t>
<t>however, <cite> have demonstrated that lexicalization does not help a collins style parser that is trained on this corpus, and <cite> have shown that its context free representation is a poor approximation to the underlying dependency structure.. </t>
<t><cite> used giza++ to word align the verbmobil task (english and german) and the canadian hansards task (english and french) and tested the coverage of itgs and xitgs, i.e. the ratio of the number of alignment configurations that could be induced by the theories and the sentences in the two tasks.. </t>
<t>feature weights were set with minimum error rate training <cite> on a development set using <cite> as the objective function.. </t>
<t>consider the following example (see figure # for an illustration)  in recent work dealing with pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue <cite>, different types of expressions (noun phrases, verb phrases, whole utterances and disfluencies) had to be annotated.. </t>
<t>however, as the purpose of the predicate argument statistics is to evaluate the preference of the candidates in semantics, it is possible that the statistics based semantic feature could be more effectively applied in the twin candidate <cite> that focusses on the preference relationships among candidates.. </t>
<t>in other closely related work, <cite> use frequent dependency subtrees as measured by tf idf to identify named entities and ie patterns important for a given domain.. </t>
<t>in our experiments we identify sl (chinese) nes implicitly found by the word segmentation algorithm stated in <cite>, and the dictionaries for translating nes include the same one used for qsl tfidf, and the ldc chinese english ne dictionary.. </t>
<t>this problem is being addressed through automatic knowledge acquisition methods, such as unsupervised learning for domain specific lexicons <cite> and extraction patterns <cite>, which require the user to provide only a small set of lexical items of the target classes or extraction patterns for the target domain.. </t>
<t>moving on to arabic, <cite> describe a word segmentation system for arabic that uses an n gram language model over morphemes.. </t>
<t>to relieve the negative effect of srl errors, we get the multiple srl results by providing the srl system with # best parse trees of <cite>, # best parse tree of <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>first of all, we adopt the head finding rules for <cite>, and this affects sieve #, # and # which are all take advantage of the head words.. </t>
<t>to tackle this problem, in one of our recent work <cite>, we had gathered training data from parallel texts and obtained encouraging results in our evaluation on the nouns of senseval # english lexical sample task <cite>.. </t>
<t>furthermore, to provide some assessment of the quality of the predicted orderings themselves, we follow <cite> in employing kendall s t, which is a measure of how much an ordering differs from the oso     the underlying assumption is that most reasonable sentence orderings should be fairly similar to it.. </t>
<t>previous work has shown that training a segmentation model with features that are extracted from knowledge sources other than words, such as speaker interaction (e.g., overlap rate, pause, and speaker change) <cite>, or participant behaviors, e.g., note taking cues <cite>, can outperform lcseg on similar tasks.. </t>
<t>the usage of articles has been found to be the most frequent error class in the <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> outlines a computationally expensive structural manipulation tool which he has used for intra lingual translation but has yet to apply to interlingual translation.. </t>
<t>following <cite>, we use a noisy channel model to propose a ## best list of possible speech disfluency analyses.. </t>
<t>stochastic optimization methods have proven to be extremely efficient for the training of models involving computationally expensive objective functions like those encountered with our task <cite> and, in fact, the on line backpropagation learning used in the neural network parser of <cite> is a form of stochastic gradient descent.. </t>
<t>in clark and <cite> we use a cluster of ## machines, together with a parallel implementation of bfgs, to solve this problem, but need up to ## gb of ram.. </t>
<t>hence we use a beam search decoder during training and testing  our idea is similar to that of <cite> who used a beam search decoder as part of a perceptron parsing model.. </t>
<t>memorization features have been used as binary valued features indicating the presence or absence of their words <cite> or as probabilistic features indicating the probability that the two heads are coreferent according to the training data <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> presented a framework allowing direct orthographical mapping of transliteration units be tween english and chinese, and an extended model is presented in <cite>.. </t>
<t>cascaded models for fine to coarse sentiment analysis were studied by <cite>.. </t>
<t>whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense tagged corpus such as semcor is clearly useful, there is a case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a wsd system can be tuned to a given genre or domain <cite> and also because there will be words that occur with insufficient frequency in the hand tagged resources available.. </t>
<t>some properties of spanish and the encoding of syntactic information in the cast#lb treebank make it non trivial to apply the method of automatically mapping c structures to f structures used by <cite>, which assigns grammatical functions to tree nodes based on their phrasal category, the category of the mother node and their position relative to the local head.. </t>
<t>a preliminary study on the benefit of such kernels was measured on the classification accuracy of semantic arguments in <cite>.. </t>
<t>compared with supervised and semi supervised methods, <cite> s unsupervised approach for relation extraction can overcome the difficulties on requirement of a large amount of labeled data and enumeration of all class labels.. </t>
<t>to compare relations in two instance sentences x, y <cite> proposes to compare the subtrees induced by the relation arguments x #, x # and y #, y #, i.e. computing the node kernel between the two lowest common ancestors (lca) in the dependecy tree of the relation argument nodes k dtk (x, y) ? (lca (x #, x #) ,lca (y #, y #)).. </t>
<t><cite> define a relational markov network (rmn) which explicitly models long distance dependencies, and use it to represent relations between entities.. </t>
<t>in the field of language acquisition computational linguists such as <cite> have studied the unsupervised acquisition of syntactic structure, while linguists such as <cite>, <cite>, <cite> and <cite> are developing probabilistic models of the acquisition of phonology and or morphology, and <cite> experimentally tests the predictions of a bayesian model of lexical acquisition.. </t>
<t><cite> also suggested adding multiple empty words to the target sentence for ibm model #.. </t>
<t>therefore, in order to avoid recursion and over complexity, we employ a diversity motivated intra stratum sampling scheme <cite>, called kdn (k diverse neighbors), which aims to maximize the training utility of all seeds from a stratum.. </t>
<t>different from the previous skip bigram statistics which compare sentence similarities through overlapping skip bigrams <cite>, the skip bigrams we used are weighted by a decaying factor of the skipping gap in a sentence, giving higher scores to closer occurrences of skip bigrams.. </t>
<t>recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word <cite> and phrase based <cite> models to include hierarchical phrase models <cite> and bilingual synchronous grammars <cite>.. </t>
<t>other researchers have developed models for detecting agreement and disagreement in meetings, using models that combine lexical features with prosodic features (e.g., pause, duration, f#, speech rate) <cite> and structural information (e.g., the previous and following speaker) <cite>.. </t>
<t>for the feature based methods, <cite> employed maximum entropy models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features in relation extraction, and achieved the f measure of ##.# on the ## relation subtypes in the ace rdc #### corpus.. </t>
<t>an important observation in <cite> is that the binary classification problems used to derive theta are not necessarily those problems we are aiming to solve.. </t>
<t>with these techniques we reach a parsing accuracy similar to <cite>, but with an order of magnitude less parameters, resulting in more efficient parsing.. </t>
<t>by running the hpsg parser described in section #.# on the development data without dependency constraints, we obtain similar values of lp <cite> and lr <cite> as those reported by <cite>.. </t>
<t>we used <cite> for ner, and the penn treebank (ptb) <cite> converted to dependency trees for <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> showed how the restriction to projective dependency graphs could be lifted by using graph transformation techniques to preprocess training data and post process parser output, so called pseudo projective parsing.. </t>
<t>machine learning techniques have been proposed for sentiment classification <cite> based on annotated samples from experts, but they have limited performance especially when estimating ratings of a multi point scale <cite>.. </t>
<t>hashimoto et al s method constructs a network of templates based on their co occurrence in web sentences with a small number of polarity assigned seed templates and infers the polarity of all the templates in the network by a constraint solver based on the spin model <cite>.. </t>
<t>the experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to significantly outperform the state of the art coherence model by <cite>, reducing the error rate of the previous approach by an average of ##  over three data sets against human upper bounds.. </t>
<t>the main difference between this approach and ours is that <cite> s approach takes coreference resolution one step further, by comparing the results of multiple systems, while our system is a single resolver  furthermore, he emphasizes the global optimization of ranking clusters obtained locally, whereas our focus is on globally optimizing the clusterization method inside the resolver.. </t>
<t>features extracted from the output of three probabilistic parsers of <cite>, one trained on wall street <cite>, one trained on a distorted version of the tree bank obtained by automatically creating grammatical error and adjusting the parse trees, and the third trained on the union of the original and distorted versions.. </t>
<t>recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word <cite> and phrase based <cite> models to include hierarchical phrase models <cite> and bilingual synchronous grammars <cite>.. </t>
<t>for the phrase based system, we generated the annotations needed by first parsing the source sentence e, aligning the source and candidate translations with the word alignment model used in training, and projected the dependency tree to the target using the algorithm of <cite>.. </t>
<t>while data sparsity is a common problem of many nlp tasks, it is much more severe for sentence compression, leading <cite> to question the applicability of the channel model for this task altogether.. </t>
<t><cite> show that good performance on unsupervised syntax learning is possible even when learning from very small discriminative neighborhoods, and we posit that the same holds here.. </t>
<t>for the learning of patterns we used the top ## documents retrieved by google and to recognize the named entities in the pattern we apply several strategies, namely  #) the stanford s conditional random field based named entity recognizer <cite> to detect entities of type human  #) regular expressions to detect numeric and date type entities  #) gazetteers to detect entities of type location.. </t>

<t>the system, introduced in <cite>, implements a joint model that captures dependencies among arguments of a predicate using log linear models in a discriminative re ranking framework.. </t>
<t>we first exploit the pivot based method proposed by bannard and <cite> to populate our graph g using of candidate paraphrases cp    from a bilingual parallel corpus b for a query phrase q.. </t>
<t>we set the number of projections k  #### for all three methods and for pleb and fast pleb, we set number of permutations p  #### as used in large scale noun clustering work <cite>.. </t>
<t>we therefore experiment with multiple such conventions with apparently similar meanings   here, emoticons (following <cite>) and twitter hash tags   allowing us to examine the similarity of classifiers trained on independent labels but intended to detect the same underlying class.. </t>
<t>because of the fundamental nature of the semantic similarity problem, there are close connections with other areas of human language technologies such as information retrieval <cite>, text alignment in machine translation <cite>, text summarization <cite>, and textual coherence <cite>.. </t>
<t>our model for disentanglement fits into the general class of graph partitioning algorithms <cite> which have been used for a variety of tasks in nlp, including the related task of meeting segmentation <cite>.. </t>
<t>given an automatically parsed corpus, <cite> extract from each parse tree a dependency path, which is represented as a sequence of nodes and dependency labels connecting a pronoun and a candidate antecedent, and collect statistical information from these paths to determine the likelihood that a pronoun and a candidate antecedent connected by a given path are coreferent.. </t>

<t>recent work by <cite> utilized phrasal statistical machine translation (smt) techniques to correct esl writing errors and demonstrated that this data intensive smt approach is very promising, but they also pointed out smt approach relies on the availability of large amount of training data.. </t>
<t>it was shown in <cite> that pairs of words that often appear together in such symmetric patterns tend to belong to the same class (that is, they share some notable aspect of their semantics).. </t>
<t>in contrast, <cite> report improved accuracy through self training for a two stage parser and re ranker.. </t>

<t><cite> proposed a constituent reordering model for a bracketing transduction grammar (<cite>, which predicts the probability that a pair of subconstituents will reorder when combined to form a new constituent.. </t>
<t>this assumption is realistic  while truly parallel data (humanly created) might be in short supply or harder to acquire, adapting statistical machine translation (smt) systems from one language pair to another is not as challenging as it used to be <cite>.. </t>
<t>in our context, bootstrapping has a similar motivation to the annealing approach of <cite>, which also tries to alter the space of hidden outputs in the e step over time to facilitate learning in the m step, though of course the use of bootstrapping in general is quite widespread <cite>.. </t>
<t>however, if one were to use rule markov models with a conventional cky style bottom up decoder <cite>, the complexity would increase to o (n cm # v  # (g #)), where c is the maximum number of outgoing hyper edges for each node in the translation forest, and m is the order of the rule markov model.. </t>

<t>it might be the case that a larger k best, or revisiting previous strategies for y+ and y  selection, such as bold updating, local updating <cite>, or maxbleu updating <cite> might have a greater impact.. </t>
<t>although <cite> use the links introduced by closure to boost the amount of training data for a tlink classifier, this technique is not suitable for our learning task since the closure might easily propagate errors in the automatic annotations.. </t>

<t><cite> adapted a phrase based mt model for normalizing sms and achieved satisfying performance.. </t>
<t>of course, it is always possible to look at accuracy figures by dependency type in order to understand what a parser is good at, as recommended by <cite>, but it is also desirable to have a single score reflecting the overall accuracy of a parser, which means that the construction s overall contribution to the score is relevant.. </t>
<t><cite> demonstrated and counted cases where cohesion was not maintained in hand aligned sentence pairs, while <cite> showed that a soft cohesion constraint is superior to a hard constraint for word alignment.. </t>
<t>alternative notions of mildly non projective dependency structures are explored in <cite>.. </t>
<t>our work is related to previous work on domain independent unsupervised relation extraction, in particular <cite>, <cite> and <cite>. <cite> introduces on demand information extraction, which aims at automatically identifying salient patterns and extracting relations based on these patterns.. </t>
<t>deterministic annealing  in this system, in stead of using the regular <cite> whose training objective is to minimize the one best error, we use the deterministic annealing training procedure described in <cite>, whose objective is to minimize the expected error (together with the entropy regularization technique).. </t>
<t>nevertheless, many of the practically useful spell checkers incorporate context information and the current analysis on spellnet can be extended for such spell checkers by conceptualizing a network of words that capture the word co occurrence patterns <cite>.. </t>
<t>we expect our reimplementation of the method to extract data more accurately, since we use a more robust parser (<cite>), take into account more syntactic structures (coordination, passive), and extract our data from a newer version of the bnc.. </t>
<t>we used an out of the box implementation of the <cite>, a competitive word alignment system, to construct an unsupervised alignment over the ## test sentences, based on the larger training corpus.. </t>

<t>with the exception of <cite> which tried to adapt a wsd system trained on the bc part of the dso corpus to the wsj part of the dso corpus, the other researchers simply applied active learning to reduce the annotation effort required and did not deal with the issue of adapting a wsd system to a new domain.. </t>

<t>due to the annotation and work of <cite>, we are now able to create natural language processing (nlp) systems that take advantage of the internal structure of noun phrases in the penn treebank.. </t>
<t>however, their dependency based evaluation does not make use of the grammatical function labels, which are provided in the corpora and closely correspond to the representations used in recent work on formalism independent evaluation of parsers <cite>.. </t>
<t>this motivated the popular domain adaptation solution based on instance weighting, which assigns larger weights to those transferable instances so that the model trained on the source domain can adapt more effectively to the target domain <cite>.. </t>
<t>note that the objective function in equation #, if written in the additive form, leads to a cost function reminiscent of the one used in constraint driven learning algorithm (<cite> (and similarly, posterior regularization <cite>, which we will discuss later at section #).. </t>

<t>we use five sentiment classification datasets, including the widely used movie review dataset [<cite> as well as four datasets containing reviews of four different types of products from amazon [books (boo), dvds (dvd), electronics (ele), and kitchen appliances (<cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> used statistical machine translation for query expansion and took a step towards bridging the lexical gap between questions and answers.. </t>
<t>there also have been prior work on maintaining approximate counts for higher order language models (<cite> operates under the model that the goal is to store a compressed representation of a disk resident table of counts and use this compressed representation to answer count queries approximately.. </t>
<t>in this section, we show that many relationships are consistently expressed using a compact set of relation independent lexico syntactic patterns, and quantify their frequency based on a sample of ### sentences selected at random from an ie training corpus developed by <cite>.. </t>
<t>in syntax based method, word reordering is implicitly addressed by translation rules, thus the performance is subject to parsing errors to a large extent <cite> and the impact of syntax on reordering is difficult to single out <cite>.. </t>
<t>in statistical machine translation (smt), methods that incorporate translations from other languages <cite> have proven effective in low resource situations  when phrase translations are unavailable for a certain language, one can look at other languages where the translation is available and then translate from that language.. </t>
<t>first, if we want to find the map derivations of the training strings, then following <cite>, we can use annealing  raise the probabilities in the sampling distribution to the #t power, where t is a temperature parameter, decrease t to wards zero, and take a single sample.. </t>
<t>the learning algorithm for level # dependency is similar to the guided learning algorithm for labelling as described in <cite>.. </t>
<t>in future work, we intend to expand our analysis of both the gold standard answer and the student answers beyond the bag of words paradigm by considering basic logical features in the text (i.e., and, or, not) as well as the existence of shallow grammatical features such as predicate argument structure <cite> as well as semantic classes for words.. </t>

<t>the first direct use of packed forest is proposed by <cite>.. </t>
<t>of ten, there are many derivations that are distinct yet produce the same translation. <cite> present a latent variable model that describes the relationship between translation and derivation clearly.. </t>
<t><cite> introduce a whole family of models of compositionality based on vector addition and point wise multiplication (and a weighted combination of both), evaluated on a sentence similarity task inspired by <cite>.. </t>
<t>there are two common assumptions within a cluster of related documents <cite>  trigger consistency per cluster  if one instance of a word triggers an event, other instances of the same word will trigger events of the same type.. </t>
<t>titov and <cite> proposed a joint model of text and aspect ratings which utilizes a modified lda topic model to build topics that are representative of ratable aspects, and builds a set of sentiment predictors.. </t>
<t><cite> showed that a single model for morphological segmentation and syntactic parsing of hebrew yielded an error reduction of ##  over the best pipelined models.. </t>
<t>similar to the definition of tree sequence used in a single parse tree defined in <cite> and <cite>, a tree sequence in a forest also refers to an ordered sub tree sequence that covers a continuous phrase without overlapping.. </t>
<t>in addition to the features described in <cite>, a new feature is added to the model for the bias rule weight, allowing the translation system to effectively tune the probability of the rules added by translation model adaptation in order to improve performance on the tuning set.. </t>
<t>our parser achieved an f score of ##.#on the test data, which is comparable to the accuracy achieved by recent discriminative approaches such as <cite> and <cite>, but is not as high as the state of the art accuracy achieved by the parsers that can incorporate global features such as <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>our experiments investigate the effectiveness of  #) the basics s scm for dependency parsing  #) a combination of the ss scm with <cite> s semi supervised approach (even in the case we used the same unlabeled data for both methods)  #) the two stage semi supervised learning approach that in ###corporates a second order parsing model.. </t>
<t>recent research indicates that using labeled and unlabeled data in semi supervised learning (ssl) environment, with an emphasis on graph based methods, can improve the performance of information extraction from data for tasks such as question classification <cite>, web classification <cite>, relation extraction <cite>, passage retrieval <cite>, various natural language processing tasks such as part of speech tagging, and named entity recognition <cite>, word sense disambiguation <cite>, etc.. </t>
<t><cite> uses a set of aligned phrases across related languages to learn how to segment words with a bayesian model and is otherwise fully unsupervised.. </t>
<t>traditionally, such unsupervised em trained hmm taggers are thought to be inaccurate, but <cite> showed that by feeding thee m process with sufficiently good initial probabilities, accurate taggers <cite> can be learned for both english and hebrew, based on a (possibly incomplete) lexicon and large amount of raw text.. </t>
<t>we use the following fairly standard features in our tagger  current word, suffixes and prefixes of length #, # and #  additionally we use word cluster features <cite> for the current word, and transition features of the cluster of the current and previous word.. </t>
<t><cite> also used this method to show how well translations could be learned from monolingual corpora under ideal conditions, where the contextual and temporal distribution of words in the two monolingual corpora are nearly identical.. </t>
<t>features # and # are inspired by the work of <cite>, who investigated unsupervised learning of narrative event sequences using point wise mutual information (pmi) between syntactic positions.. </t>
<t><cite> used a segment based decoder for word segmentation and pos tagging.. </t>
<t><cite> proposes a cascaded linear model for joint chinese word segmentation and pos tagging.. </t>
<t>for example, <cite> present the combination of two state of the art dependency parsers feeding each another, showing that there is a significant improvement over the simple parsers.. </t>
<t>our parser achieved an f score of ##.# on the test data, which is comparable to the accuracy achieved by recent discriminative approaches such as <cite> and <cite>, but is not as high as the state of the art accuracy achieved by the parsers that can incorporate global features such as <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> exploit shallow correspondences of hierarchical rules with source syntactic constituents extracted from parallel text, an approach also investigated by <cite>.. </t>
<t>recently, several studies have shown that offering more alternatives of annotations to smt systems will result in significant improvements, such as replacing # best trees with packed forests <cite> and replacing # best word segmentations with word lattices <cite>.. </t>
<t>we are particularly interested in the usage of recursive patterns for the learning of semantic relations not only because it is a novel method, but also because recursive patterns of the dap fashion are known to  (#) learn concepts with high precision compared to singly anchored pat terns <cite>, (#) use only one seed instance for the discovery of new previously unknown terms, and (#) harvest knowledge with minimal supervision.. </t>
<t>our application is also atypical for an nlp application in that we use an approximate sampler not only to include bayesian prior in formation (section #), but also because computing phrase alignment expectations exactly is a  p hard problem <cite>.. </t>
<t>as another example, <cite> and <cite> perform joint inference for anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution, by using integer linear programming (ilp) to enforce the consistency between the output of the anaphoricity classifier and that of the coreference classifier.. </t>
<t>the re ranking parser of charniak   johnson adapted to the biomedical domain <cite>.. </t>
<t>to learn from an unaligned corpus, we derive a new training algorithm that combines the generalized grounding graph (g#) framework introduced by tellex et al <cite> with the policy gradient method described by branavan et al <cite>.. </t>
<t>we found that using the unsupervised model of <cite> to automatically produce aligned training scenarios (section #.#.#) was less effective than it was in the other two domains due to two factors  (i) there are fewer training examples in sumtime and unsupervised learning typically works better with a large amount of data  and (ii) the alignment model does not exploit the temporal structure in the sumtime world state.. </t>
<t>more recently, this algorithm was extended to work with hyper graphs encoding a huge number of translations produced by mt systems based on synchronous context free <cite>.. </t>
<t>there have been some related works that focus on discovering the general topics and ideological perspectives in online discussions <cite>, placing users in support oppose camps <cite>, and classifying user stances <cite>.. </t>
<t>more recently, <cite> proposed a co training approach to tackle the problem of cross lingual sentiment classification by leveraging an available english corpus for chinese sentiment classification.. </t>
<t>recall that (i) <cite> proposed a afactor graph (fig. #) in which they run loopy bp, and that (ii) <cite> approximate parsing as the solution of a linear program.. </t>
<t>in this section, we start by defining a transition system for joint tagging and parsing based on the non projective transition system proposed in <cite>.. </t>
<t>pr  the posterior regularization (pr) approach of <cite>, in which a supervised english parser is used to generate constraints that are projected using a parallel corpus and used to regularize a target language parser.. </t>
<t><cite> employs integer linear programming to select a minimal set of parameters that can generate the test sentences, followed by em to set parameter values.. </t>
<t>on the chinese side, we used the morphological analyzer described in <cite> trained on the training data of ctbtp to perform word segmentation and pos tagging and used the first order parsers to parse all the sentences in the data.. </t>
<t><cite> describe a process to induce a partially ordered set of events related by a common protagonist by using an unsupervised distributional method to learn relations between events sharing co referring arguments, followed by temporal classification to induce partial order.. </t>
<t>while researchers who evaluate their resolvers on gold nps point out that the results can more accurately reflect the performance of their co reference algorithm, <cite> argue that such evaluations are unrealistic, as np extraction is an integral part of an end to end fully automatic resolver.. </t>
<t>another research line is to exploit various linguistically informed features under the framework of supervised models, <cite> and <cite>, e.g., polarity features, semantic classes, tense, production rules of parse trees of arguments, etc. our study on pdtb test data shows that the average f score for the most general # senses can reach ##.#  when we simply mapped the ground truth implicit connective of each test instance to its most frequent sense.. </t>
<t><cite> present a nonparametric pscfg translation model that directly induces a grammar from parallel sentences without the use of or constraints from a word alignment model, and <cite> achieve the same for tree to string grammars, with encouraging results on small data.. </t>
<t><cite> further improved the method by introducing a usability sub model into the paraphrase model so as to generate varied paraphrases for different applications.. </t>
<t>although this assumption does limit the space of possible word level alignments, for the domain we consider (chinese english word alignment), the reduced space still contains almost all empirically observed alignments <cite>.. </t>
<t>additionally, their aggregate decisions make use of mintzstyle aggregate features <cite>, that collect evidence from multiple sentences, while we use ### inputs  (#)?, a set of sentences, (#) e, a set of entities mentioned in the sentences, (#) r, a set of relation names, and (#)?, a database of atomic facts of the form r (e# ,e#) for r? r and ei? e.. </t>
<t>our phrase pair clustering approach is similar inspirit to the work of <cite>, who use k means to cluster (monolingual) phrases and use the resulting clusters as features in discriminative classifiers for a named entity recognition and a query classification task.. </t>
<t>the state of the art for recognizing all types of explicit connectives in english is therefore already high, at ##  accuracy for disambiguating discourse vs. non discourse uses <cite> and ##  for disambiguating the four main senses from the pdtb hierarchy <cite>.. </t>
<t>a bayesian learned tree substitution grammar <cite>.. </t>
<t>previous work on graph based dependency parsing mostly adopts linear models and perceptron based training procedures, which lack probabilistic explanations of dependency trees and do not need to compute likelihood of labeled training #higher order models of <cite> and <cite> can achieve higher accuracy, but has much higher time cost (o (n#)).. </t>
<t>the robustness of this simple approach is well documented  e.g., <cite> show that the baseline model (gazetteer features without unsupervised features) produces an f# of .### against .### of the best unsupervised word representation feature.. </t>
<t><cite> used latent dirichlet <cite> to model templates  latent senses, determining rule applicability based on the similarity between the two sides of the rule when instantiated by the context, while <cite> used lda to model argument classes, considering a rule valid for a given argument instantiation if its instantiated templates are drawn from the same hidden topic.. </t>

<t>the sa component is implemented according to <cite>, which incorporates target dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph based optimization.. </t>
<t>for the shared task, we made use of data drawn from the clc fce dataset, a set of #,### exam scripts written by candidates sitting the cambridge esol first certificate in english (fce) examination in #### and ####, and made available by cambridge universiy <cite>.. </t>

<t>we applied our method to wikipedia articles using freebase as a knowledge base and found that (i) our model identified patterns expressing a given relation more accurately than baseline methods and (ii) our method led to better extraction performance than the original <cite> and <cite>, which is a state of the art multi instance learning system for relation extraction (see section #).. </t>
<t><cite> and <cite> used the annotated logical forms to compute answers for their experiments.. </t>
<t>in recent years research in natural language processing (nlp) has been steadily moving towards multilingual processing  the availability of ever growing amounts of text in different languages, in fact, has been a major driving force behind research on multilingual approaches, from morphosyntactic <cite> and syntactico semantic <cite> phenomena to high end tasks like textual entailment <cite> and sentiment analysis <cite>.. </t>
<t>the use of case frames is well grounded in a variety of nlp tasks relevant to summarization such as coreference resolution <cite>, and information extraction <cite>, where they serve the central unit of semantic analysis.. </t>
<t><cite> show that even though global approaches can be improved, local methods based on only similarity sim (d, e) of context d and entity e are hard to beat.. </t>
<t>recognizing the limitations of existing systems, <cite> develop a pos tagger specifically for twitter, by creating a training corpus as well as devising a tag set that includes parts of speech that are uniquely found in on line language, such as emoticons (smilies).. </t>
<t>mert was done only for the baseline system  these same weights were used for all experiments to control for the effect of mert instability. in the future, we plan to experiment with approach specific optimization and to use recent published suggestions on controlling for optimizer instability <cite>.. </t>
<t>the speed of our parser is ### tokens per second, which is over # times faster than an exact third order parser that at figure #  example sentence.tains uas of ##.##  and comparable to the state of the art transition based system of <cite> that employs beam search.. </t>
<t>we plan to extend this work by taking into account the notion of word sense as it is done in <cite> or <cite>  since werely on occurrences of words in texts, this extension should be quite straightforward by turning our word in context classifiers into true word sense classifiers.. </t>
<t>recursive neural networks, which have the ability to generate a tree structured output, are applied to natural language parsing <cite>, and they are extended to recursive neural tensor networks to explore the compositional aspect of semantics <cite>.. </t>
<t>to resolve referring expression, one of the well known methods is centering theory developed by grosz, joshi, and weinstein (<cite>).. </t>
<t>rim builds upon <cite> and <cite> by conceptually extending the edit signal hypothesis that repairs are acoustically or phonetically marked at the point of interruption of fluent speech.. </t>
<t>description theory (henceforth, d theory) (<cite>).. </t>
<t>such as earley deduction, to coestruct a parser, a.s shown in <cite>.. </t>
<t>one example of the gap between description and computational implementation is disjunctive feature representation, which became popular in feature based grammar formalisms in the ####s <cite>.. </t>
<t>the family of grammar models that are based on such formalisms include generalized phrase structure grammar (gpsg) <cite>, lexical functional grammar (lfg) <cite>, functional unification grammar (bug) <cite>, head driven phrase structure grammar (i ipsg) <cite>, and categorial unification grammar (cug) <cite>.. </t>
<t>nearly all existing unification grammars of this kind use either term unification (the kind of unification used in resolution theorem provers, and hence provided as a primitive in prolog) or some version of the graph unification proposed by <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>it is also closer to some methods for incremental daptation of discourse structures, where additions are allowed to the right frontier of a tree structure <cite>.. </t>
<t>second, in keeping with ontological promiscuity <cite>, we represent the importance of attributes by the salience of events and states in the discourse model   these states and events now have the same status in the discourse model as any other entities.. </t>
<t>this amounts to the simplest case of the restriction technique of <cite>.. </t>
<t>while the work of <cite> relied on special lexicons, one might instead want to learn information about the semantic content of different role fillers and then assess for each of the potential referents in the discourse context whether their semantic content is close enough to the expected content of the null instantiated role.. </t>
<t><cite> emphasized the importance of a property sharing constraint.. </t>
<t>the approach that vijay <cite> and <cite> take, elaborated on by <cite>, is to identify a very general class of formalisms, which they call linear context free rewriting systems (cfrss), and define for this class a large space of structural descriptions which serves as a common ground in which the strong generative capacities of these formalisms can be compared.. </t>
<t>in section #, i compare the results of my algorithm with the results of the centering algorithm <cite> with and without specifications for complex sentences <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> and <cite> have tackled this problem and proposed unification methods for disjunctive feature descriptions.. </t>
<t>as shown in  interpretation as <cite>, abductive inference is inference to the best explanation.. </t>
<t>after experimenting with several tagging methods, we concluded that the approach presented in <cite> adopted from <cite> best captured the aspects of the dialogue we were interested in and, as with the das, could be tagged reliably on our data.. </t>
<t>this approach is adopted from text generation where plan operators are responsible for choosing linguistic means in order to create coherent stretches of text (see, for instance, <cite> and <cite>).. </t>
<t>the actual realization of the component is based on a constraint based inheritance algorithm that follows the example of <cite>.. </t>
<t>z (#) d   l j  i (d  # )dmax  max distance used wl  the i th letter in the sentence w g (d)  a certain weight for iv   concerning distance between letters the information between two remote words has less nmaning in a sentence when it comes to the semantic analysis <cite>.. </t>
<t>one is the case in which a pronoun x correctly says that it is coreferent with another pronoun y. however, the program misidentifies the antecedent of y. in this case (sometimes called error chaining <cite>), both x and y are to be scored as wrong, as they both end up in the wrong coreferential chain.. </t>
<t>an architecture which fulfills this requirement is weighted constraint dependency grammar, which was based on a model originally proposed by <cite> and later extended with weights <cite>.. </t>
<t>the next set of lookup levels described, in which the structural word is no longer the primary entity but just a handle for indexing graphs, can be built on the basis of knowledge assembled from large volumes of text  the methodology employed by <cite> would be one of many techniques possible for obtaining and organizing the various levels of model graphs.. </t>
<t><cite> uses a mutual information based metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in a large corpus to classify nouns.. </t>
<t>however, bilingual parallel corpora have mostly been used for tasks related to word sense disambiguation such as target word selection <cite> and separation of senses <cite>.. </t>
<t>this model is trained on approximately # million sentence pairs of hansard (canadian parliamentary) and un proceedings which have been aligned on a sentence by sentence basis by the methods of <cite>, and then further aligned on a word by word basis by methods similar to <cite>.. </t>
<t>alignment is performed using dynamic programming <cite> with a weight function based on the number of common words in a sentence pair.. </t>

<t>first, a quasi logical form allows the under specification of several types of information, such as anaphoric references, ellipsis and semantic relations <cite>.. </t>
<t>results of testing the first stage of this model, the lexical pattern matcher, are reported in <cite>  ### of ### utterance containing nontrivial  repairs in their ##,### utterance corpus were correctly identified, while ### fluent utterances were incorrectly identified as containing repairs.. </t>
<t>for this we use an approach similar to pereira and schabes  grammar induction from partially bracketed text <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> attempted to adapt    to award partial credit for near misses by using the percentage agreement metric of <cite> to compute actual agreement which conflates multiple manual segmentations together according to whether a majority of coders agree upon a boundary or not.. </t>
<t><cite> used a composite method in which the first pass does alignment at the level of characters asin <cite> (itself based on cognate matching) and the second pass uses ibm model #, following <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> constructs a simple word to word translation model and then takes the alignment that maximizes the likelihood of generating the corpus given the translation model.. </t>
<t>kupiec proposes an mgorithm for finding noun phrases in bilingual corpora <cite>.. </t>
<t>instead, the dependency tree is built stepwise and the decision about what step to take next (e.g. which dependency to insert) can be based on information about, in theory all, previous steps and their results (in the context of generative probabilistic parsing, <cite> call this the history).. </t>

<t><cite>, we adopt a flat model of topic segmentation for our gold standard based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational agents.. </t>
<t><cite> and <cite>, clusters of similar words are evaluated by how well they are able to recover data items that are removed from the input corpus one at a time.. </t>
<t>as evaluation measure, we used a pair wise measure which calculates precision, recall and a harmonic fscore as follows  each verb pair in the cluster analysis was compared to the verb pairs in the gold standard classes, and evaluated as true or false positive <cite>.. </t>
<t>distributional clustering of words was first proposed by pereira <cite>  they cluster nouns according to their conditional verb distributions.. </t>
<t>c. <cite> presents the acquisition of sub categorization frames from unlabelled text corpora.. </t>
<t>this idea is not new, but as far as we know it has been implemented in rule based taggers and parsers, such as <cite>, <cite>, <cite> and <cite>, but not in models based on probability distributions.. </t>
<t>as in <cite>, the second method exploits lexical cohesion to segment exts, but in a different way.. </t>
<t>discourse segmentation of the documents composed of parallel parts is a novel and challenging problem, as previous research has mostly focused on the linear segmentation of isolated texts (e.g., <cite>).. </t>
<t>work on sentence alignment of english and <cite>, indicates that the lengths of english and chinese texts are not as highly correlated as in french english task, leading to lower success rate <cite> for length based aligners.. </t>
<t>until now, many methods have been proposed for this problem including winnow based algorithms <cite>, differential grammars <cite>, transformation based learning <cite>, decision lists <cite>.. </t>
<t>the synset similarity metric defined by <cite> combines the path length and synset depth intuitions into a single numeric score that is defined as follows  #? depth (lca (synset#, synset#)) depth (synset#)+ depth (synset#) <cite> in equation ## ,lca returns the lowest common ancestor of the two synsets within the wordnet is a hierarchy.. </t>
<t>an example of the type of feature used is the part of speech of the word to the right  see <cite> for the other ones we use.. </t>

<t>decision trees have been applied for feature selection for statistical parsing models by <cite> and haruno et al.. </t>
<t>the underlying assumption is that translations of words that are related in one language are also related in the other language <cite>.. </t>
<t>this feature set is similar to the one used by <cite>, as well as by a number of state of the art word sense disambiguation systems participating in the senseval # and senseval #evaluations.. </t>
<t>the <cite> approach is fully supervised and produces a final meaning representation in sql.. </t>
<t>we have proposed a modification and extension of <cite> s normal form that is more appropriate for commonly used variants of ccg with grammatical type raising and generalized composition of bounded degree, as well as some non combinatory extensions to ccg.. </t>

<t>conventional smoothing techniques, such as kneser ney and witten bell back off schemes (see <cite> for an empirical overview, and <cite> for a bayesian interpretation), perform back off on lower order distributions to provide an estimate for the probability of these unseen events.. </t>

<t>in general, the word segmentation program utilizes the word entries, part of speech (pos) information <cite> in a monolingual dictionary, segmentation rules <cite>, and some statistical information <cite>.. </t>
<t>this can be seen as a generalization of the one to one assumption for word to word translation used by <cite> and is exploited for the same purpose, i.e. to exclude large numbers of candidate alignments, when good initial alignments have been found.. </t>
<t>of the several slightly different definitions of a base np in the literature we use for the purposes of this work the definition presented in <cite> and used also by <cite> and others.. </t>

<t>in this paper the relevance feedback approach described by <cite> is evaluated using three data sets  the nlm <cite> which <cite> used for their experiments, the senseval # lexical sample task <cite> and the coarse grained version of the semeval english lexical sample task <cite>.. </t>
<t>indeed, only # out of the ## systems in the recent senseval # english all words task <cite> outperformed the heuristic of choosing the most frequent sense as derived from semcor <cite>.. </t>
<t>rouge l, rouge w, and rouge s have also been applied in automatic evaluation of summarization and achieved very promising results <cite>.. </t>
<t>hence, the use of a named entity tagger supports the evaluation results when comparing the various biomedical entity recognition <cite>.. </t>
<t>we evaluate our methods on the icsi meeting recorder dialog act (<cite> corpus, and find that our novel hidden back off model can significantly improve dialog tagging accuracy.. </t>
<t>recently, <cite> applied an ilp model to the task of the simultaneous assignment of semantic roles to the entities mentioned in a sentence and recognition of the relations holding between them.. </t>
<t><cite> used a log likelihood test to select their features, probably because of the intuition that candidate words whose occurrence depends on whether the ambiguous word occurs will be indicative of one of the senses of the ambiguous word and hence useful for disambiguation <cite>.. </t>
<t>in the experiments below, we employ a data driven deterministic dependency parser producing labeled projective dependency graphs,# previously tested on <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>we considered as baseline semantic scattering which is a new learning model <cite> developed in house for the semantic classification of noun noun pairs in np constructions.. </t>
<t>for predicate argument structure analysis, we have the following representative large corpora  <cite>, <cite>, and <cite> in english, the chinese <cite> in chinese, the <cite>, kyoto text <cite>, and the naist <cite> in japanese.. </t>
<t><cite> explore issues with annotating speculative language in biomedicine and out line potential applications.. </t>
<t>first, there is some evidence suggesting that standoff annotation and embedded xml are the two most highly preferred corpus annotation formats, and second, these for mats are employed by the two largest extant curated biomedical corpora, <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>additionally, we exploit the flexibility of the discriminative framework both to improve the treatment of unknown words as well as to include span features <cite>, giving the benefit of some input features integrally in our dynamic program.. </t>
<t>other types of relations that have been studied by pattern based approaches include question answer relations (such as birthdates and inventor) <cite>, synonyms and antonyms <cite>, general purpose analogy <cite>, verb relations (including similarity, strength, antonym, enable ment and temporal) <cite>, entailment <cite>, and more specific relations, such as purpose, creation <cite>, livesin, and <cite>.. </t>
<t>on line usage of web queries is less frequent and was used mainly in semantic acquisition applications  the discovery of semantic verb relations <cite>, the acquisition of entailment relations <cite>, and the discovery of concept specific relationships <cite>.. </t>
<t>more recently, <cite> proposed to merge an english parser, a word alignment model, and a korean pcfg parser trained from a small number of korean parse trees under a unified log linear model.. </t>
<t>a web interface was developed in order to annotate each pair, following the distinction introduced by <cite>  parallel indicates sentence aligned texts that are in translation relation  noisy characterizes two documents that are never the less mostly bilingual translations of each other  topic corresponds to documents which share similar topics, but that are not translation of each others and very non that stands for rather unrelated texts.. </t>
<t>for our baseline srl model, we adopt the features used in other state of the art srl systems, which include the seven baseline features from the original work of <cite> ,additional features taken from <cite>, and feature combinations which are inspired by the system in <cite>.. </t>
<t>for example, <cite> is widely used for a number of semantic processing tasks, including semantic role labeling <cite>, the creation of semantic parse trees <cite>, and implicit argument resolution <cite>.. </t>
<t>paraphrase generation can be viewed as monolingual machine translation <cite>, which typically includes a translation model and a language model.. </t>
<t>the performance of the two word segmentation baselines (juman and mecab) is significantly worse in our task than in the standard word segmentation task, where nearly ##  precision and recall are reported <cite>.. </t>
<t>in the rest of the paper, we call this operation mode joint s t. experiments of <cite> shown that, compared with performing segmentation and pos tagging one at a time, joint s t can achieve higher accuracy not only on segmentation but also on pos tagging.. </t>
<t><cite> describe this approach within the context of a maximum entropy classifier, but the idea is more general.. </t>
<t>the details of the algorithm and its efficient implementation are given in <cite>.. </t>
<t>the method first constructs a sentence connectivity graph based on cosine similarity and then selects important sentences based on the concept of eigenvector centrality <cite>.. </t>
<t>similarly to the distortion penalty in the conventional phrase based decoder <cite>, the distortion cost of jumping from a word at position i to another word at position j, d (i, j), is proportional to the distance between i and j ,e.g.,  i j .. </t>
<t>in this paper, we show that a method for extractive summarization relying on iterative graph based algorithms, as previously proposed in <cite> can be applied to the summarization of documents in different languages without any requirements for additional data.. </t>
<t>another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text <cite>.. </t>
<t>the systems that we compared with are  the syn#, syn## and goldsyn systems by <cite>, the system scissor by <cite>, an svm based system krips by <cite>, a synchronous grammar based system wasp by <cite>, the ccg based system by <cite> and the work by <cite>.. </t>
<t>these were first annotated with semantic roles using a state of the art semantic role labeling system <cite>.. </t>
<t>our method follows and substantially extends the earlier work of <cite>, who use syntactic features and unlabelled dependencies to evaluate mt quality, outperforming bleu on segment level correlation with human judgement.. </t>
<t>we also used the paraphrase database terp for <cite>.. </t>
<t>in line with many other researches (e.g., <cite>), we determine these anchors using different similarity or relatedness dec tors  the exact matching between tokens or lemmas, a similarity between tokens based on their edit distance, the derivation ally related form relation and the verb entailment relation in wordnet, and, finally, a wordnet based similarity <cite>.. </t>
<t>while formulated very differently, one limiting case of our algorithm relates closely to the exh algorithm of <cite>.. </t>
<t>we present a statistical parser that is based on a shift reduce algorithm, like the parsers of <cite> and <cite>, but performs a best first search instead of pursuing a single analysis path in deterministic fashion.. </t>
<t><cite> and <cite> explore the usefulness of semantic roles provided by <cite> for both opinion holder and opinion target extraction.. </t>
<t>they measure compositionality as a combination of two similarity values  firstly, similar to <cite>, the similarity (cosine similarity) between the context of a vnc and the contexts of its constituent words.. </t>
<t>inside the moses toolkit, three different statistical approaches have been implemented  phrase based statistical machine translation (<cite>, hierarchical phrase based statistical machine translation <cite> and syntax based statistical machine translation <cite>.. </t>
<t>we are only aware of one work that performs a systematic comparison of smoothing techniques in phrase based machine translation systems <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> append the source domain labeled data with predicted pivots (i.e. words that appear in both the source and target domains) to adapt a pos tagger to a target domain.. </t>
<t>the standard approach to framing dependency parsing as an integer linear program was introduced by <cite>, who converted the mst parser of <cite> to use ilp for inference. the key idea is to build a complete graph consisting of tokens of the sentence where each edge is weighted by a learned scoring function.. </t>
<t><cite>, the authors use the transcripts of debates from the us congress to automatically classify speeches as supporting or opposing a given topic by taking advantage of the voting records of the speakers.. </t>
<t>similarly, <cite> used wordnet to expand seed lists with fuzzy sentiment categories, in which words could be more central to one category than the other. finally, <cite> used syntactic features and context coherency, defined as the tendency for same polarities to appear successively, to acquire polar atoms.. </t>
<t>however since the contextual information in a domain is specific, the model got by their approach cannot easily converted to other domains. <cite> used an integer linear programming approach to jointly extract entities and relations in the context of opinion oriented information extraction.. </t>
<t>supersense learner brings together under one system the features previously used in the <cite> and the <cite> all words word sense disambiguation systems.. </t>
<t>for each pair of nodes (u, v) in the graph, we compute the semantic similarity score (using wordnet) between every pair of dependency relation (rel  a, b) in u and v as  s (u, v)  reli u ,relj v reli relj wn (ai ,aj) wn (bi ,bj), where rel is a relation type (e.g., nsubj) and a, b are the two arguments present in the dependency relation (b does not exist for some relations). wn (wi ,wj) is defined as the wordnet similarity score between words wi and wj. the edge weights are then normalized across all edges in the #there exists various semantic relatedness measures based on <cite>.. </t>
<t>given a pair of document collections a and b, our goal is not to construct classifiers that can predict if a document was written from the perspective of a or b <cite>, but to determine if the document collection pair (a, b) convey opposing perspectives.. </t>
<t>the standard procedure for this purpose would be cross validation. however, the popular data sets used for bench marking parsers, such as those that emerged #### from the conll x shared task on dependency parsing <cite>, are typically based on monolingual text.. </t>
<t><cite> is an incremental deterministic classifier based parser.. </t>
<t>ulisse was tested against the output of two really different data driven parsers  the first order maximum spanning tree (mst) parser <cite> and the <cite> using support vector machine as learning algorithm.. </t>
<t><cite> is a language independent system for data driven dependency parsing which is freely available. it is based on a deterministic parsing strategy in combination with tree bank induced classifiers for predicting parsing actions.. </t>
<t><cite> attribute the inferiority of their model and the marcu and wong model to a hidden segmentation variable, which enables the em algorithm to maximize the probability of the training data without really improving the quality of the model.. </t>
<t>the first contrastive submission is a phrase based system, enhanced with a triplet lexicon model and a discriminative word lexicon model <cite> both trained on in domain news commentary data only as well as a sentence level single word lex icon model and a discriminative reordering model <cite>.. </t>
<t>the results of last year s workshop further suggested that bleu systematically underestimated the quality of rule based machine translation systems <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> started with a complete set of phrases as extracted by traditional pbmt heuristics, and then annotated the target side of each phrasal entry with the label of the constituent node in the target side parse tree that subsumes the span.. </t>
<t>for cube growing, we use a non duplicate k best method <cite> to get ### best unique translations according to lm to estimate the lower boundheuristics. this preprocessing step takes on aver age #.## seconds per sentence, which is negligible in comparison to the +lm decoding time.. </t>
<t>to perform rating inference on reviews, <cite> created a graph on both labeled and unlabeled reviews, and then solved an optimization problem to obtain a smooth rating function over the whole graph.. </t>
<t>we use chinese <cite>, a special case of mcl that performs the iteration in a more aggressive way, with an optimized linear complexity with the number of graph edges.. </t>
<t>for instance, incorporating wsd predictions into an mt decoder based on inversion transduction grammars <cite> such as the bracketing itg based models of <cite>, <cite>, or <cite> would present an intriguing comparison with the present work.. </t>
<t>we have also shown in passing that the linear interpolation of translation models may work less well for translation model adaptation than the multiple paths decoding technique of <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> applied a mixture model approach to adapt the system to a new domain by using weights that depend on text distances to mixture components.. </t>
<t>although bleu has played a crucial role in the progress of mt research, it is becoming evident that bleu does not correlate with human judgement well enough, and suffers from several other deficiencies such as the lack of an intuitive interpretation of its scores. during the recent acl ## workshop on statistical <cite>, a total of automatic mt evaluation metrics were evaluated for correlation with human judgement.. </t>
<t>the pooled model for pairing data from abstracts and claims is trained on data composed of ###,### sentences from each text section. another approach to exploit commonalities between tasks is to train separate language and translation models on the sentences from each task and combine the models in the global log linear model of the smt framework, following <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>this problem is similar to the task of automatic translation output evaluation and so we use <cite>, an automatic mt evaluation metric for com paring two sentences.. </t>
<t>these features include whether the two strings are the same, two terms have the same stem, the similarity between the two terms either based on wordnet or distributional statistics <cite>. to learn the alignment model for nouns, we annotated the noun alignments for the development data used in pascal rte # <cite> and trained a logistic regression model based on the features in table #.. </t>
<t><cite> present an approach to preposition error detection which also uses a model based on a maximum entropy classifier trained on a set of contextual features, together with a rule based filter.. </t>
<t>while word senses have been studied extensively in lexical semantics, research has focused on word sense disambiguation, the task of disambiguating words in context given a predefined sense inventory (e.g., <cite>), and word sense induction, the task of learning sense inventories from text (e.g., <cite>).. </t>
<t>for example, in the english coarse grained all words task <cite> at the recent semeval workshop the base line of choosing the most frequent sense using the first wordnet sense attained precision and recall of ##.#  which is only a few percent lower than the top scoring system which obtained ##.# .. </t>
<t>our first experiment is carried out on the semeval #### lexical substitution task dataset <cite>.. </t>
<t>sections # and # presents in more detail the implementation of the framework for the semeval #### <cite> and semeval .. </t>
<t>in order to drive forward research on temporal relation identification, the semeval #### shared task <cite> (tempeval) included the following three tasks.. </t>
<t>in this paper the relevance feedback approach described by <cite> is evaluated using three data sets  the nlm <cite> which <cite> used for their experiments, the senseval # lexical sample task <cite> and the coarse grained version of the semeval english lexical sample task <cite>.. </t>
<t>our parser achieves the best published results to date on the semeval ## <cite>.. </t>
<t>in the projective case, the arc factored assumption can be weakened in certain ways while maintaining polynomial parser runtime <cite>, but not in the non projective case <cite>, where finding the highest scoring tree becomes np hard.<cite> adopted an approximation based on o (n#) projective parsing followed by rearrangement to permit crossing arcs, achieving higher performance.. </t>
<t>we followed the benchmark assessment procedure in wmt and nist <cite>, assessing the performance of the propose devaluation metric at the sentence level using ranking preference consistency, which also known as kendall s rank correlation coefficient, to evaluate the correlation of the proposed metric with human judgments on translation adequacy ranking.. </t>
<t>these models are conducive to mt to some extent, since they commonly have relatively good aggregate performance and segmentation consistency <cite>. but one outstanding problem is that these models may leave out some crucial segmentation features for smt, since the output words conform to the tree bank segmentation standard designed for monolingually linguistic intuition, rather than specific to the smt task.. </t>
<t>we word aligned the corpus with <cite>, a multi threaded implementation of the standard word alignment tool <cite>.. </t>
<t>while previous work uses the stanford corenlp toolkit to identify characters and extract typed dependencies for them, we found this approach to be too slow for the scale of our data (a total of #.# billion tokens)  in particular, syntactic parsing, with cubic complexity in sentence length, and out of the box co reference resolution (with thousands of potential antecedents) prove to be #all categories are described using the stanford typed dependencies <cite>, but any syntactic formalism is equally applicable.. </t>
<t>the key idea in our approach is to allow highly flexible reordering operations, in combination with a discriminative model that can condition on rich features of the source language input string. our approach builds on a variant of tree adjoining grammar (<cite>) (specifically, the formalism of <cite>).. </t>
<t>the conll #### shared task <cite> was on joint parsing and semantic role labeling, but the best systems <cite> were the ones which completely decoupled the tasks.. </t>
<t>spearman s rank correlation coefficients on the document (system) level between all the metric sand the human ranking are computed on the english, french, spanish, german and czech texts generated by various translation systems in the framework of the third <cite>, fourth <cite> and fifth <cite> shared translation tasks.. </t>
<t>we use joshua, a java based open source implementation of the hierarchical decoder <cite>, release #.#.# word alignment was computed using the first three steps of the train factored phrase model.perl script packed with <cite>.. </t>
<t>further approaches to domain adaptation for smt include adaptation using in domain language mod els <cite>, meta parameter tuning on in domain development sets <cite>, or translation model adaptation using self translations of in domain source language texts <cite>.. </t>
<t>additionally, the average scores for adequacy and fluency were themselves averaged into a single score, following <cite>, and the spearman s correlation of each of the automatic metrics with these scores are given in table #.. </t>
<t>morante and daelemans describe a method for improving resolution of the scope of negation by combining igtree, crf, and support vector <cite>.. </t>
<t>used the state of the art named entity tagger of <cite> to label the text.. </t>
<t>the approach to resolving the scopes of hedge cues that we present in this paper is similar to the approach followed in <cite> in that the task is modelled in the same way.. </t>
<t>the bionlp ## <cite> was the first shared task that provided a consistent data set and evaluation tools for extraction of such biological relations.. </t>
<t>since we were additionally interested in determining colour signatures for emotions (section #), we chose to annotate all of the ##,### word sense pairs that <cite> used to create their word emotion lexicon.. </t>
<t>that paper appeared in a naacl #### workshop organized by callison <cite>, focusing on mturk as a source of data for speech and language tasks.. </t>
<t>#### experiments were carried out for the system combination task of the fifth workshop on statistical machine translation <cite> in four directions, czech, french, german, spanish   to <cite>, and we found comparable performance to the conventional confusion network based system combination in two language pairs, and statistically significant improvements in the others.. </t>
<t>although we are not bound to a specific composition model, throughout this paper we use the method proposed by <cite> and <cite> which defines composition as application of linear transformations to the two constituents followed by summing the resulting vectors  f comp r ( u,  v)  w #  u+w #  v. we will further use the following equivalent formulation  f comp r ( u,  v)  w r [ u   v] where w r? r d? #dand [ u   v] is the vertical concatenation of the two vectors (using matlab notation).. </t>
<t>it continues sampling a specification tree for each text specification until it finds one which successfully reads all of the input examples. the second baseline aggressive is a state of the art semantic parsing framework <cite>. the framework repeatedly predicts hidden structures (specification trees in our case) using a structure learner, and trains the structure learner based on the execution feedback of its predictions.. </t>
<t>similarly, <cite> used a pure rule based approach based on constituent parse trees in addition to syntactic dependency relations, and achieved the fourth best f score for scope detection, and the highest precision of the whole task <cite>.. </t>
<t>other resources for sentiment detection include the dictionary of affect in language (dal) to score the prior polarity of words, as in <cite> on social media data.. </t>
<t>this paper presents the umass entry to the bionlp #### shared task <cite>.. </t>
<t>we describe the stanford entry to the bionlp #### shared task on biomolecular event extraction <cite>.. </t>
<t>our system builds on an earlier system that we evaluated in the conll #### shared task <cite>, where we optimized significantly the solver code, most notably the mention detection step and the feature design.. </t>
<t>in particular, the top performing system in the conll #### shared task <cite> is a multi pass system that applies tiers of deterministic co reference sieves from highest to lowest precision <cite>.. </t>
<t>the goal of our experiments is to demonstrate the behaviour of the decoder and characterise its response to changes in the fundamental search parameters. the smt models for our experiments were created with a subset of the training data for the english french shared task at the wmt #### workshop <cite>.. </t>
<t>we evaluate translation quality using <cite>, both on the word and character level (with n  #), as well as <cite> on the word level.. </t>
<t>furthermore, the extraction of grammars for training is done in a leave one out fashion <cite> where rules are extracted for a parallel sentence pair only if the same rules are found in other sentences of the corpus as well.# gram (news commentary) and # gram (europarl) language models are trained on the data described in table #, using the <cite> and binarized for efficient querying using kenlm <cite>.. </t>
<t>nevertheless, in the context of this quality evaluation shared task (see <cite> for a detailed description) we have also used supervised learning as a final stage, in order to submit results which can be compared to other methods (see? #). we investigate the use of various similarity measures for evaluating the quality of machine translated sentences.. </t>
<t>this estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word align <cite>.. </t>
<t>there has also been a rethinking of the traditional modular nlg architecture <cite>.. </t>
<t>in the meantime, <cite> <cite> proposed a method to acquire context dependent pos disambiguation rules and created an accurate tagger, even from a very small annotated text by combining supervised and unsupervised learning.. </t>
<t><cite> also present a model with multiple back offs.. </t>
<t><cite> builds a classifier based on a rich set of context features.. </t>
<t>the verbs are tagged with respect to senses in <cite>, which has become widely used, for example in corpus annotation projects <cite> and for performing disambiguation (resnik #### and leacock et ai.. </t>
<t>text chunking model <cite>, which has been previously applied to <cite>.. </t>
<t>al <cite> extracted such likely cognates for czech english using one of the variations of <cite> described in <cite> as a similarity measure.. </t>
<t>for the part of speech tagging, the memory based tagger <cite>, trained on the wall street journal corpus#, was used.. </t>
<t>bag of words feature sets made up of unigrams have had a long history of success in text classification and word sense disambiguation <cite>, and we believe that despite creating quite a bit of noise can provide useful information for discrimination.. </t>
<t>for instance, implementing an efficient version of the mxpost <cite> will simply involve composing and configuring the appropriate text file reading component, with the sequential tagging component, the collection of feature extraction components and the maximum entropy model component.. </t>
<t>although we omit the details, we can prove the np hardness by observing that a stochastic tree substitution grammar (stsg) can be represented by a pcfg la model in a similar way to one described by <cite>, and then using the np hardness of <cite>.. </t>
<t>the fact that the improvement is larger for pp attachment than for full parsing is suggestive of pp attachment being a parsing subtask where lexical semantic information is particularly important, supporting the findings of <cite> over a standalone pp attachment task.. </t>
<t>for the computation of related terms and synonyms, <cite>, <cite>, and <cite> used the cosine measure, whereas <cite> used a weighted jaccard measure.. </t>
<t>the annotation of word senses such as used by machine learning based word sense disambiguation (wsd) tools corresponds to the task of selecting the correct semantic class or concept for a word from an underlying ontology such as <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> introduced the idea of oracle re ranking  suppose there exists a perfect re ranking scheme that magically picks the best parse that has the highest f score among the top k parses for each sentence.. </t>
<t>as in most other statistical parsing systems we therefore use the pruning technique described in <cite> and <cite> which assigns a score to each item in the chart equal to the product of the inside probability of the item and its prior probability.. </t>
<t><cite> investigates techniques for identifying non compositional compounds in english french parallel corpora and emphasises that translation models that take non compositional compounds into account are more accurate.. </t>
<t><cite> presented a corpus based method that can be used to build semantic lexicons for specific categories.. </t>
<t>our method of name discrimination is described in more detail in <cite>, but in general is based on an unsupervised approach to word sense discrimination introduced by <cite>, which builds upon earlier work in word sense discrimination, including <cite> and <cite>.. </t>
<t>a variety of approaches exist for determining the salient sentences in the text  statistical techniques based on word distribution <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, symbolic techniques based on discourse structure <cite> and semantic relations between words <cite>.. </t>
<t>we select the hyper parameters of our model using an independent development set, which we extract from the lexical resource <cite>.. </t>
<t>baldwin s <cite> is a knowledge poor approach to anaphora resolution based on a set of high confidence rules which are successively applied over the pronoun under consideration.. </t>
<t>then, following previous studies (e.g., <cite>), we use the synsets relations in word net for query expansion.. </t>
<t>there are number of different existing approaches for identifying semantic roles, varying from traditional parsing approaches, for example using hpsg grammars and lexical functional grammars, that strongly rely on manually developed grammars and lexicons, to data driven approaches, for example <cite>.. </t>
<t>some of the data comes from the parsed files # ## of the wall street journal penn <cite>, and additional parsed text was obtained by parsing the wall street journal text using the parser described in <cite>.. </t>
<t>for instance, maximum entropy may be used when a high diversity of knowledge sources are to be taken into account <cite>.. </t>
<t><cite> s probabilistic approach combines three factors (aside from the agreement filter)  the result of the hobbs algorithm, mention count dependent on the position of the sentence in the article, and the probability of the antecedent occur ring in the local context of the pronoun.. </t>

<t>the e<cite> project aims to transform the wordnet glosses into a format that allows the derivation of additional semantic and logic relations.. </t>
<t>second, using a heuristic proposed in <cite>, all the aligned phrase pairs (x?, a?, y?) satisfying the following criteria are extracted  (#) x? and y? consist of consecutive words of x and y, and both have length at most k, (#) a? is the alignment between words of x? and y? induced by a, (#) a? contains at least one link, and (#) there are no links in a that have just one end in x? or y?.. </t>

<t>this paper has presented and evaluated an extended bootstrapping model based on <cite> that uses a unified framework of both entity internal and contextual evidence.. </t>
<t><cite> collins and singer show that unlabeled data can be used to reduce the level of supervision required for named entity classification.. </t>
<t><cite> used a similar framework in the context of constituent parsing and only three base parsers.. </t>
<t>an obvious choice for a baseline in this task is the following  any two sentences are considered aligned if their cosine similarity exceeds a certain threshold. we also compare our algorithm with two state of the art systems, <cite> and <cite>.. </t>

<t>the original idea was then extended by hogler et al. <cite> and crabtree et al. <cite> to dual energy x ray absorptiometry (dxa). the studies by hogler et al. <cite> and crabtree et al. <cite> showed how the associations between body height and lean body mass as well as between lean body mass and bmc can be used to differentiate between primarily bone or muscle defects. the feasibility of this novel approach to the interpretation of dxa data has been validated in the spectrum of disorders manifesting in bone, muscle or both tissues <cite>, however, its relevance in discriminating the pediatric subpopulation with non traumatic fractures has, to date, not yet been fully proven <cite>. the bh lbm ratio in the ijo patients was calculated to evaluate whether the surrogate of muscle mass during disease is adequate for the body height when compared to control subjects, because muscle mass scales with body height <cite>. tbbmc lbm and sbmc lbm ratios allowed us to investigate whether bmc of the whole skeleton and lumbar spine, respectively, are normally adapted to the surrogate of muscle mass <cite>. we applied the diagnostic algorithm proposed by schonau <cite> as modified by hogler et al. <cite> and investigated by crabtree et al. <cite>, to assess whether low bmd in ijo may be related to disturbances in muscle tissue. it has been shown that the decreased bone mineral content and density reported in cases of duchenne muscular dystrophy, immobility or restricted movement were primarily related to decreased muscle mass, as assessed by dxa derived lean body mass <cite>. to assess the magnitude of evidenced disturbances, the amounts of bone mineral content in relation to lean body mass were analyzed as bmc lbm ratios <cite>, introduced recently as the modern    relative bone strength (rbs)    indices <cite>. interestingly, crabtree et al. found in a group of british children with fragility fractures that dxa assessed bmc was also lower than expected for the normal lbm noted in this group <cite>. it was found that british children with fractures of mixed aetiology had z scores of    #.#  #.# and    #.#  #.# for the tbbmc lbm and sbmc lbm ratios, respectively <cite>. however, the data reported by crabtree et al. <cite> and that of our study support the concept that reduced amounts of bmc for a normal lbm may be associated with increased risk for fracture, at least in children. at the same time, recently proposed diagnostic algorithms <cite> based on the analyses of tbbmc lbm and sbmc lbm ratios, presented as the    relative bone strength    indices <cite>, provide additional and meaningful data for diagnostic purposes and, hopefully, for proper therapeutic decisions.</t>

<t>therefore, team norms and o ther means may be needed to encourage agents to consider the good o f the group when making decisions about their commitments <cite>. in earlier work <cite>, we used spire to examine the effect of team norms, environmental factors, and agent characteristics on the decisions and outcomes of members of homogeneous groups of agents. our experimental framework u ses the brownie points model developed by glass and grosz <cite> to incorporate this type of consideration into decision making, allowing u s to study its effect on ou tcomes, as well as its susceptibility to manipulation. for the experiments in this paper, we assume that agents are also uncertain about the duration of their collaboration, and therefore use the infinite horizon version o f the fei f ormula described by glass and grosz <cite>. # . in prior work <cite>, we refer to this score as the agent   s rank. in addition to b eing concerned about its income, an agent may also derive utility from being a    good gu y.    glass and grosz   s brownie point model captures this aspect of agents    utilities <cite>, providing a measure of an agent   s sense of its reputation as a responsible collaborator. all of them also use brownie points, with a bpweight of #.# (a setting that falls in the optimal range determined by glass and grosz <cite>). the bp loss from defaulting on a task is quadratic in the task   s value <cite>, so agents who receive lower valued tasks compute smaller bp losses. this result is similar to one from glass and grosz   s earlier work on brownie points <cite>, which showed that a moderate level of social consciousness (i.e., a moderate bpweight) is better from the individual perspective, since otherwise agents turn away even the most highly valued outside offers.</t>

<t>in <cite>, <cite>, we develop various cooperative diversity algorithms for a pair of terminals based upon relays amplifying their received signals or fully decoding and repeating information. as in <cite>, <cite>, limited feedback from the destination terminal provides one means of overcoming such bandwidth inefficiencies, but we do not repeat the analysis here. with the results of <cite>, <cite>, the analysis can be extended to amplify and forward, for which similar performance characteristics can be obtained. both classes of algorithms consist of two transmission phases, as in <cite>, <cite>. this section highlights the system model that we employ to develop extensions of the repetition based algorithms in <cite>, <cite> as well as the space   time coded cooperative diversity algorithms. differences between the model employed here and the one employed in <cite>, <cite> include a larger number of terminals and different medium access control protocols for repetition based and space   time coded cooperative diversity. as in <cite>, <cite>, we focus on the case of slow fading and measure performance by outage probability to isolate the benefits of space diversity. note that these are the same basic restrictions on medium access control protocols described in <cite>, <cite>. fig. # illustrates example channel and subchannel allocations for repetition based cooperative diversity, in which relays either amplify what they receive or fully decode and repeat the source signal, as in <cite>, <cite>. in our setting with fading, as we increase , the two parameterizations yield tradeoffs between different aspects of system performance  results under exhibit a tradeoff between the normalized snr gain and spectral efficiency of a protocol, while results under exhibit a tradeoff between the diversity order and normalized spectral efficiency of a protocol <cite>, <cite>. interestingly, potential relays that cannot decode contribute as much to the performance of the protocol as the decoding relays, just as in the selection decode and forward algorithm developed for two terminals in <cite>, <cite>. as in <cite>, <cite>, the event that this mutual information random variable falls although the analysis can be extended to the parallel channel case <cite>, <cite>, we focus in this paper on repetition coding because of its low complexity and on space   time coded cooperative diversity because it offers even larger mutual informations, and therefore enhanced bandwidth efficiency, when compared to <cite>. fig. # compares the diversity exponents, along with the corresponding tradeoff for noncooperative transmission, , from <cite>, <cite>. extending our earlier results for two cooperating terminals <cite>, <cite>, we have analyzed repetition based and space   time coded cooperative diversity in nonergodic settings using outage probability as a performance measure.</t>

<t>initially, the continuum models for animal movement and aggregation were mainly of parabolic type <cite>. however, since the parabolic models unrealistically assume that organisms can move with infinite speeds along infinitely random paths, scientists are focusing more and more on hyperbolic and kinetic models <cite>. in contrast, for local models the turning and speeding behaviors are influenced only by local conspecifics <cite>. another aspect considered by these hyperbolic and kinetic models for selforganized aggregations is the possibility of having demographic effects, in addition to movement in response to local or nonlocal conspecifics <cite>. in general, they are modeled by quadratic (logistic) terms <cite> or cubic terms <cite>, although competition and prey   predation effects could also be easily incorporated. this approach has been reviewed, for example, by  <cite> , <cite>, <cite>. a similar equation (with no drift,   #   #, but with a reaction term) was investigated by  <cite>  in the context of population dispersal. for detailed discussions of such models see  <cite> , <cite>, <cite>, <cite>, <cite>. these equations have been used, for example, to study animal dispersal <cite>, or to model epidemiological problems when the movement of infected individuals can be described by a correlated random walk process <cite>. system <cite> was also shown to exhibit traveling front solutions <cite>.</t>

<t>some investigators <cite> noted parallels between judgments of contingency by human subjects and classical conditioning in animals. models of classical conditioning have recently sparked new interest <cite> because of their formal similarities to adaptive network models. however, recent research using multiple cues has indicated that cues interact such that the predictive strength of one cue influences the judged predictiveness of alternative cues <cite>. two examples of such cue interaction are blocking and conditioned inhibition, both phenomena first discovered in animal conditioning experiments <cite>, but subsequently demonstrated in contingency judgment tasks with humans <cite>. similar results have been obtained by other investigators <cite>.  <cite>  recently pointed out the similarities between associative models of animals learning and adaptive network models <cite>.  <cite>  described a network model that is formally equivalent to the rescoda wagner model and explored its suitability as a model of contingency judgment. the weights of the links from input nodes to output nodes were altered according to the least mean squares (lms) rule, which  <cite>  noted is equivalent to the rescoda wagner learning rule, because according to both rules the change in strength of a particular node or cue is some fraction of the discrepancy between actual and expected outcomes. consequently, particular network models often differ from the  <cite>  model. similar medical diagnosis tasks have been used in other investigations of contingency judgment <cite>. if many intermixed trials are presented, as in the koh and meyer experiments, the two classes of models yield identical predictions <cite>  therefore, koh and meyer s results do not distinguish between the statistical and associative models presented here. associative models such as the rescoda wagner model or the  <cite>  network model are most similar to linear regression.</t>

<t>while there have been many demonstrations of lifelogging technology, with some exceptions <cite> rather less is known about how it will be used in everyday life. prior work <cite> concerning memory processes argues that memories are often inferential rather than involving mental re experiencing or recalling of the original event. prior work <cite> suggests that lifelogging tools can both promote such reconstructive inferences, as well as support genuine recall. one exception <cite> showed that automatically captured visual cues can effectively cue recall of the past, but in the longer term (longer than three months) these cues act more to support people   s inferences about their past, rather than to support true recollection. this recall probe is typical of those used in prior studies of everyday memory <cite>. again following prior research <cite>, we classified recall into different events, e.g. recall versus inference test in addition to describing the event, participants were asked, for each event, to state how they were recalling it, and whether they remembered, knew, or guessed (a common distinction in memory tests <cite>). however this finding is consistent with similar studies <cite>. consistent with <cite>, snaps led to some inferencing, but events recalled with snaps were more likely to be true recollective memories than either tracks or snaptracks.</t>

<t>wigderson <cite>. using tools from information theory, we prove a strong round elimination lemma for communication complexity that enables us to obtain a tight lower bound for the predecessor problem. we also use our round elimination lemma to obtain a rounds versus communication tradeoff for the    greaterthan    problem, improving on the tradeoff in <cite>. <cite>). a partial answer to both of the above questions was given by miltersen, nisan, safra and wigderson <cite>. bound proved by <cite> is weaker than that of <cite>, their approach had two advantages  their lower bound holds for randomised query schemes too, and the proof is much simpler. we prove our lower bound for predecessor searching by combining the approach in <cite> with a new round elimination lemma for communication complexity. our round elimination lemma is a strengthening of the one proved in <cite>, and we believe it is of independent interest. lower bounds for rank parity imply similar lower bounds for some other data structure problems like point separation <cite> and two dimensional reporting range query<cite>. for example, let us consider communication protocols for the    greater than    problem gtn in which alice and bob are given bit strings x and y respectively of length n each, and the goal is to find out if x   y or not (treating x, y as integers between # and #n     #). miltersen, nisan, safra and wigderson <cite>, and the starting point of our work is the paper of miltersen, nisan, safra and wigderson <cite> showing lower bounds for randomised cell probe schemes for predecessor. fact <cite> let f   x   y     z be a function. note that in the round elimination lemma of <cite>, the dependence between    and    is quadratic. in fact, their quantum lower bound for the    tree pointer chasing    problem is better than its previously known classical lower bound <cite>! an important ingredient of their quantum lower bound was a quantum information theoretic result called average encoding theorem. the information theoretic arguments have to be combined with yao   s minimax lemma <cite> <cite> to prove the strong round elimination lemma of this paper. the information theoretic approach brings out more clearly the intuition behind round elimination, as opposed to the ad hoc combinatorial proof in <cite>. we now recall some facts about the connection between cell probe schemes for predecessor and communication complexity of rank parity from <cite>. proof  the proof is similar to the proof of the lower bound for predecessor in <cite>, but with different parameters, and using our stronger round elimination lemma in its classical version (lemma #). proof  we recall the following reduction from gt (k),a n k to gtn <cite>  in gt</t>

<t>genes, or regions of the genome, that have been affected by natural selection may show an excess of functionally important molecular changes, beyond what would be expected in the absence of selection. genomic regions with such an excess of changes are said to have experienced positive selection, i.e., selection in favor of new genetic variants. the most common statistical technique for detecting positive selection takes advantage of the fact that mutations in coding regions of genes come in two classes  nonsynonymous mutations that change the resulting amino acid sequence of the protein and synonymous mutations, which do not change the encoded protein. an excess of nonsynonymous mutations over synonymous mutations, beyond what would be expected if the two types of mutations occur at the same rate, provides strong evidence for the past action of positive selection at the protein level. using this logic, there have recently been numerous studies documenting positive selection in a variety of genes and organisms, including immune response related genes [</t>

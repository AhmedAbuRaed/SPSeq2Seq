testing subgraphs in directed graphs. we show that in this case g contains at least f(e, h)nh copies of h. this is proved by establishing a directed version of szemeredi s regularity lemma, and implies that for every h there is a one sided error property tester whose query complexity is bounded by a function of e only for testing the property ph of being h free.as is common with applications of the undirected regularity lemma, here too the function # f(e,h) is an extremely fast growing function in e. we therefore further prove a precise characterization of all the digraphs h, for which f(e,h) has a polynomial dependency on e. this implies a characterization of all the digraphs h, for which the property of being h free has a one sided error property tester whose query complexity is polynomial in # e. we further show that the same characterization also applies to two sided error property testers as well. we also show that the complexity of deciding if for a given directed graph h, ph has a polynomial query complexity, is np complete, marking an interesting distinction from the case of undirected graphs.for some special cases of directed graphs h, we describe very efficient one sided error property testers for testing ph. as a consequence we conclude that when h is an undirected bipartite graph, we can give a one sided error property tester with query complexity o((# e)h #), improving the previously known upper bound o((# e)h#).

delay bounds in a network with aggregate scheduling. this paper studies the bounds on the worst case delay in a network implementing aggregate scheduling. we derive an upper bound on the queuing delay as a function of priority traffic utilization and the maximum hop count of any flow, and the shaping parameters at the network ingress. our bound explodes at a certain utilization level which is a function of the hop count. we show that for a general network configuration and larger utilization utilization an upper bound on delay, if it exists, must be a function of the number of nodes and or the number of flows in the network.

novel adaptive nonlinear predistorters based on the direct learning algorithm. other available types are either slow to converge, complicated in structure and computationally expensive, or do not consider the memory effects in nonlinear systems such as a high power amplifier (hpa). in this paper, we first propose several novel adaptive nonlinear predistorters based on direct learning algorithms   the nonlinear filtered x rls (nfxrls) algorithm, the nonlinear adjoint lms (nalms) algorithm, and the nonlinear adjoint rls (narls) algorithm. using these new learning algorithms, we design adaptive nonlinear predistorters for an hpa with memory effects or for an hpa following a linear system. moreover, our developed adaptive nonlinear predistorters are computationally efficient and or converge rapidly when compared to other adaptive nonlinear predistorters that use direct learning, and furthermore can be easily implemented. we further simplify our proposed algorithms by exploring the robustness of our proposed algorithm as well as by examining the statistical properties of what we call the  instantaneous equivalent linear  (iel) filter. simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms
molecular basis for the discrimination of repressive methyl lysine marks in histone h# by polycomb and hp# chromodomains. here we show that the chromodomain proteins polycomb (pc) and hp# (heterochromatin protein #) are highly discriminatory for binding to these sites in vivo and in vitro. in drosophila s# cells, and on polytene chromosomes, methyl lys ## and pc are both excluded from areas that are enriched in methyl lys # and hp#. to better understand the molecular basis for the selection of methyl lysine binding sites, we solved the #.# a structure of the pc chromodomain in complex with a h# peptide bearing trimethyl lys ##, and compared it with our previously determined structure of the hp# chromodomain in complex with a h# peptide bearing trimethyl lys #. the pc chromodomain distinguishes its methylation target on the h# tail via an extended recognition groove that binds five additional residues preceding the arks motif.

identifying the agricultural imprint on the global n#o budget using stable isotopes. we observed large shifts with time in the emission rate (from ### to ## ng n cm   # h   #) and in   ##n of n#o emitted (from    ##    to +#    relative to atmospheric n#) from a urea fertilized and irrigated agricultural field in mexico. we calculated overall instantaneous enrichment factors for the sampling period, which suggest that the microbial n#o production shifts from nitrification (week #) to denitrification (week #). the overall   ##n signature we measured for n#o emitted from n fertilized agricultural systems is more depleted than observed   ##n values for n#o emitted from more n limited forest soils. assuming that one half of the total agricultural n#o emissions associated with the global increase in soil nitrogen fertilizer use have an isotopic composition comparable to those of the agricultural fields reported here, we predict a decline in the isotopic signature of tropospheric n#o during this century of as much as #    for ##n. although many uncertainties remain, we suggest that measurements of   ##n n#o in firn air will provide constraints on how the n#o budget has changed during the past century.
localization of peripherin rds in the disk membranes of cone and rod photoreceptors relationship to disk membrane morphogenesis and retinal degeneration. a mutation in the gene for this protein has been reported to be responsible for retinal degeneration in the rds mouse. in the present study, we have shown by immunogold labeling of rat and ground squirrel retinas that peripherin rds is present in the disk rims of cone outer segments as well as rod outer segments. additionally, in the basal regions of rod and cone outer segments, where disk morphogenesis occurs, we have found that the distribution of peripherin rds is restricted to a region that is adjacent to the cilium.

contagion and differentiation in unethical behavior the effect of one bad apple on the barrel. in a world where encounters with dishonesty are frequent, it is important to know if exposure to other people s unethical behavior can increase or decrease an individual s dishonesty. in experiment #, our confederate cheated ostentatiously by finishing a task impossibly quickly and leaving the room with the maximum reward. in line with social norms theory, participants  level of unethical behavior increased when the confederate was an in group member, but decreased when the confederate was an out group member. in experiment #, our confederate instead asked a question about cheating, which merely strengthened the saliency of this possibility.

optimal portfolio selection with consumption and nonlinear integro differential equations with gradient constraint a viscosity solution approach. we study a problem of optimal consumption and portfolio selection in a market where the logreturns of the uncertain assets are not necessarily normally distributed. we characterize the value function of the singular stochastic control problem as the unique constrained viscosity solution of the associated hamilton jacobi bellman equation. first, we prove that the value function is a constrained viscosity solution of an integro differential variational inequality. second, to ensure that the characterization of the value function is unique, we prove a new comparison (uniqueness) result for the state constraint problem for a class of integro differential variational inequalities. in the case of hara utility, it is possible to determine an explicit solution of our portfolio consumption problem when the levy process posseses only negative jumps.

glioma associated hyaluronan induces apoptosis in dendritic cells via inducible nitric oxide synthase implications for the use of dendritic cells for therapy of gliomas. as a means of enhancing immunity to gliomas, we investigated local deliveryof rat, bone marrow derived dendritic cells (dcs) into rat #l gliosarcoma tumors and into #l tumors induced to undergo apoptosis by gamma knife radiosurgery. to determine whether antigen presenting cells, such as dcs, were viable in tumors, we carried out multiparametric staining of #l tumors, using phycoerythrin conjugated ox# (mhc class ii) or ox## (dc specific) and fitc labeled val ala asp fluoromethyl ketone (fitc vad fmk  activated caspases). we therefore sought to determine which glioma cell surface receptors or components of the extracellular matrix in gliomas influenced dc viability. using reverse transcription pcr, northern blot, and western blot analyses, we determined that ha stimulated production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) in dcs. using flow cytometric analyses with fitc vad fmk, which is specific for activated caspases, we also determined that induction of apoptosis in dcs with ha could be titrated.

baryon chemical potential and in medium properties of bps skyrmions. we continue the investigation of thermodynamical properties of the bogomol nyi prasad sommerfield (bps) skyrme model. in particular, we analytically compute the baryon chemical potential both in the full field theory and in a mean field approximation. in the full field theory case, we find that the baryon chemical potential is always exactly proportional to the baryon density, for arbitrary solutions. we further find that, in the mf approximation, the bps skyrme model approaches the walecka model in the limit of high density char##  their thermodynamical functions as well as the equation of state agree in this limit. the perfect fluid aspects of the bps skyrme model, which, together with its bps properties, form the base of our results, are shown to be in close formal analogy with the eulerian formulation of relativistic fluid dynamics.

optimal insurance design under rank dependent expected utility. we consider an optimal insurance design problem for an individual whose preferences are dictated by the rank dependent expected utility (rdeu) theory with a concave utility function and an inverse s shaped probability distortion function. by applying the technique of quantile formulation, we solve the problem explicitly. we show that the optimal contract not only insures large losses above a deductible but also insures small losses fully. finally, we compare our results, analytically and numerically, both to those in the expected utility framework and to cases in which the distortion function is convex or concave.

multi issue negotiation protocol for agents exploring nonlinear utility spaces. we cannot, for example, just add up the value of car s carburetor and the value of car s engine when engineers negotiate over the design a car. in this paper, we address this important gap in current negotiation techniques. we propose a negotiation protocol where agents employ adjusted sampling to generate proposals, and a bidding based mechanism is used to find social welfare maximizing deals. our experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms existing methods in large non linear utility spaces like those found in real world contexts.
dynamic multi faceted topic discovery in twitter. however, traditional text mining methods that rely on the bag of words model are insufficient to uncover the rich semantics and temporal aspects of topics in twitter. in particular, topics in twitter are inherently dynamic and often focus on specific entities, such as people or organizations. in this paper, we therefore propose a method for mining multifaceted topics from twitter streams. we develop an efficient online inference method for mftm, which enables our model to be applied to large scale and streaming data. our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our model compared with state of the art baselines. we further demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in the context of tweet clustering.

mid level smoke control for #d animation. in this paper we introduce the notion that artists should be able to control fluid simulations by providing examples of expected local fluid behavior (for instance, an artist might specify that magical smoke often forms star shapes). as our idea fits between high level, global pose control and low level parameter adjustment, we deem it mid level control. we make our notion concrete by demonstrating two mid level controllers providing stylized smoke effects for two dimensional animations. with these two controllers, we allow the artist to specify both density patterns, or particle motifs, which should emerge frequently within the fluid and global texture motifs to which the fluid should conform. each controller is responsible for constructing a stylized version of the current fluid state, which we feed back into a global pose control method. we integrate these mid level controls with an interactive animation system, in which the user can control and keyframe all animation parameters using an interactive timeline view.

timing anomalies in dynamically scheduled microprocessors. we show that this assumption is wrong in dynamically scheduled processors. we first provide necessary conditions when timing anomalies can show up and identify what architectural features that may cause such anomalies. we also show that analyzing the effect of these anomalies with known techniques results in prohibitive computational complexities. instead, we propose some simple code modification techniques to make it impossible for any anomalies to occur. our evaluation shows that the pessimism imposed by these techniques is fairly limited  it is less than ##  for the programs in our benchmark suite.

regulation of endothelial cell and platelet receptor ligand binding by the ## and ## lipoxygenase monohydroxides ## ## hete and ## hode. abstract   in previous studies, we reported that vascular wall cells such as endothelial cells metabolize linoleic acid to ## hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (## hode) via the ## lipoxygenase pathway. we and others have also found that tumour cell adhesivity is dependent, in part, upon the relative amounts of intracellular ## hode and the arachidonic acid monohydroxide(s), ##  and or ## hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (## , ## hete). in addition, we and others have found that platelet adhesivity is dependent upon the intraplatelet level of its major lipoxygenase metabolite, ## hete. finally, we have demonstrated that ## hode and vnr co localize in nonadhesive endothelial cells but dissociate following endothelial cell injury, at which time, the vnr relocates on the endothelial cell apical surface. these data suggest to us that lipoxygenase derived monohydroxides regulate the ability of various receptors to recognize their specific ligands. thus, we demonstrate that ## hode downregulates vnr binding with vitronectin (vn)   fibronectin (fn)   fibrinogen (fgn), whereas ##  and ## hete upregulate specific vnr ligand binding, using purified vnr liposomes and purified ligands in an adhesion assay  and that ##  and ## hete upregulate gpiib iiia liposome binding of fgn   fn   vn. we conclude that cell specific monohydroxides influence cell specific receptor ligand binding directly through a

improving coherence with nested environments. we have in mind a register of qubits for an quantum information system, and consider its decoherence in an idealized but typical situation. considering that the dynamics in the near environment is not sufficiently well known or controllable, we shall use random matrix methods to obtain analytic results. we consider a simplified situation where the central system suffers weak dephasing from the near environment, which in turn is coupled randomly to the far environment. we find the anti intuitive result that increasing the coupling between near and far environment actually protects the central qubit.

verifying multi threaded software using smt based context bounded model checking. we describe and evaluate three approaches to model check multi threaded software with shared variables and locks using bounded model checking based on satisfiability modulo theories (smt) and our modelling of the synchronization primitives of the pthread library. in the lazy approach, we generate all possible interleavings and call the smt solver on each of them individually, until we either find a bug, or have systematically explored all interleavings. in the schedule recording approach, we encode all possible interleavings into one single formula and then exploit the high speed of the smt solvers. in the underapproximation and widening approach, we reduce the state space by abstracting the number of interleavings from the proofs of unsatisfiability generated by the smt solvers. in all three approaches, we bound the number of context switches allowed among threads in order to reduce the number of interleavings explored. we implemented these approaches in esbmc, our smt based bounded model checker for ansi c programs. our experiments show that esbmc can analyze larger problems and substantially reduce the verification time compared to state of the art techniques that use iterative context bounding algorithms or counter example guided abstraction refinement.

study of emulsion stabilization by graft copolymers using the optical analyzer turbiscan. oil in water nanoemulsions were prepared using a series of synthetic graft copolymers with a backbone of dextran (dex) and a number of side chains of poly e caprolactone (pcl). in this paper, we focus on the o w emulsion stabilizing abilities of these novel pcl dex copolymers, using a recently developed optical analyzer (turbiscan). this study shows that pcl dex copolymers successfully stabilized ethyl acetate in water emulsions, even in the absence of additional surfactants, whereas they were not efficient in stabilizing methylene chloride in water emulsions which coalesced fast and irreversibly.
heterotachy in mammalian promoter evolution. we have surveyed the evolutionary trends of mammalian promoters and upstream sequences, utilising large sets of experimentally supported transcription start sites (tsss). unlike previous smaller studies, we have considered the effects of insertions, deletions, and transposable elements as well as nucleotide substitutions. we investigated the relationship between promoter and coding sequence selective constraint and suggest that they are generally uncorrelated. we demonstrate significant differences in divergence between functional promoter categories and identify a category of promoters, not associated with conventional protein coding genes, that has the highest rates of divergence across mammals. we find that evolutionary rates vary both on a fine scale within mammalian promoters and also between different functional classes of promoters. the discovery of heterotachy in promoter evolution, in particular the accelerated evolution of primate promoters, has important implications for our understanding of human evolution and for strategies to detect primate specific regulatory elements.

central nervous system control of food intake. new information regarding neuronal circuits that control food intake and their hormonal regulation has extended our understanding of energy homeostasis, the process whereby energy intake is matched to energy expenditure over time. to better understand how energy homeostasis can be achieved, we describe a model that delineates the roles of individual hormonal and neuropeptide signalling pathways in the control of food intake and the means by which obesity can arise from inherited or acquired defects in their function.
on the self similar nature of ethernet traffic. we demonstrate that ethernet local area network (lan) traffic is statistically  self similar,  that none of the commonly used traffic models is able to capture this fractal behavior, and that such behavior has serious implications for the design, control, and analysis of high speed, cell based networks. intuitively, the critical characteristic of this self similar traffic is that there is no natural length of a  burst   at every time scale ranging from a few milliseconds to minutes and hours, similar looking traffic bursts are evident  we find that aggregating streams of such traffic typically intensifies the self similarity ( burstiness ) instead of smoothing it.our we also consider some implications for congestion control in high bandwidth networks and present traffic models based on self similar stochastic processes that are simple, accurate, and realistic for

collaborative personalized tweet recommendation. however, an information overload problem has troubled many users, especially those with many followees and thousands of tweets arriving every day. in this paper, we focus on recommending useful tweets that users are really interested in personally to reduce the users  effort to find useful information. we propose a method of making tweet recommendations based on collaborative ranking to capture personal interests. our final method considers three major elements on twitter  tweet topic level factors, user social relation factors and explicit features such as authority of the publisher and quality of the tweet. the experiments show that all the proposed elements are important and our method greatly outperforms several baseline methods.
evidence for general instability of past climate from a ### kyr ice core record. here we present a detailed stable isotope record for the full length of the greenland ice core project summit ice core, extending over the past ### kyr according to a calculated timescale. we find that climate instability was not confined to the last glaciation, but appears also to have been marked during the last interglacial (as explored more fully in a companion paper#) and during the previous saale   holstein glacial cycle. we suggest that climate instability in the early part of the last interglacial may have delayed the melting of the saalean ice sheets in america and eurasia, perhaps accounting for this discrepancy.

integrating sample based planning and model based reinforcement learning. we show how to replace these over matched planners with a class of sample based planners   whose computation time is independent of the number of states   without sacrificing the sample efficiency guarantees of the overall learning algorithms. to do so, we define sufficient criteria for a sample based planner to be used in such a learning system and analyze two popular sample based approaches from the literature. we also introduce our own sample based planner, which combines the strategies from these algorithms and still meets the criteria for integration into our learning system. in doing so, we define the first complete rl solution for compactly represented (exponentially sized) state spaces with efficiently learnable dynamics that is both sample efficient and whose computation time does not grow rapidly with the number of states.

the nonstochastic multiarmed bandit problem. in this work, we make no statistical assumptions whatsoever about the nature of the process generating the payoffs of the slot machines. we give a solution to the bandit problem in which an adversary, rather than a well behaved stochastic process, has complete control over the payoffs. in a sequence of t plays, we prove that the per round payoff of our algorithm approaches that of the best arm at the rate o(t # #). we show by a matching lower bound that this is the best possible. we also prove that our algorithm approaches the per round payoff of any set of strategies at a similar rate  if the best strategy is chosen from a pool of n strategies, then our algorithm approaches the per round payoff of the strategy at the rate o((log n# # t # #). finally, we apply our results to the problem of playing an unknown repeated matrix game. we show that our algorithm approaches the minimax payoff of the unknown game at the rate o(t # #).

architecture of parallel spatial data warehouse balancing algorithm and resumption of data extraction. in this paper we present a parallel spatial data warehouse (psdw) system that we use for aggregation and analysis of huge amounts of spatial data. the psdw system is based on a data model called the cascaded star model. in order to provide satisfactory interactivity for psdw system, we used parallel computing supported by a special indexing structure called an aggregation tree. we have implemented two data partitioning schemes which use hilbert and peano curves for space ordering. we provide a collection of system tests results and its analysis that confirm the possibility of a balancing algorithm realization in proposed way. etl processes are sometimes interrupted by occurrence of a failure. in such a case, one of the interrupted extraction resumption algorithms is usually used. in this paper we analyze the influence of the data balancing used in psdw on the extraction and resumption processes efficiency.

prefrontal subcortical pathways mediating successful emotion regulation. to address this issue, we identified a right ventrolateral prefrontal region (vlpfc) whose activity correlated with reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images. we then applied a pathway mapping analysis on subcortical regions to locate mediators of the association between vlpfc activity and reappraisal success (i.e., reductions in reported emotion).
moving and looming stimuli capture attention. we show that translating and looming stimuli also capture attention. this phenomenon does not occur for all dynamic events  we also show that receding stimuli do not attract attention. although the sorts of dynamic events that capture attention do not fit neatly into a single category, we speculate that stimuli that signal potentially behaviorally urgent events are more likely to receive attentional priority.

quantum calabi yau and classical crystals. we propose a new duality involving topological strings in the limit of the large string coupling constant. the crystal is a discretization of the toric base of the calabi yau with lattice length g s. as a strong piece of evidence for this duality we recover the topological vertex in terms of the statistical mechanical probability distribution for crystal melting. we also propose a more general duality involving the dimer problem on periodic lattices and topological a model string on arbitrary local toric threefolds.
neurochemical architecture of the normal and degenerating rat retina. we used post embedding immunocytochemistry to determine the cellular localization of glutamate,    amino butyric acid (gaba), glycine, aspartate, glutamine, arginine, and taurine in the normal and degenerating rat retina. we tested this hypothesis by determining muller s cells glutamate uptake and degradation characteristics in adult and postnatal day ## rcs retinas. we confirmed anomalies in glutamate metabolism in rcs muller s cells by showing that exogenously applied glutamate was degraded over a longer time course in postnatal day ## rcs retinas, compared to control retinas. the anomalies of amino acid localization, uptake and degradation lead us to conclude that muller s cells in the rcs retina show abnormal function by postnatal day ##  an earlier time to previously reported anatomical and functional changes in this animal model of retinal degeneration.

decorrelating detectors for a dual rate synchronous ds cdma system. this paper addresses the use of decorrelating detectors for a dual rate ds cdma system that serves both low bit rate and high bit rate users. we assume that in an interval of duration t sub # , a low rate user transmits one bit while a high rate user transmits m bits. applying a standard decorrelator to the interval of duration t sub #  yields an m bit processing delay for high rate users and a computational complexity that grows with m. we propose a decorrelator that generates bit decisions for each high rate user in every subinterval of duration t sub #  m. to decode a low rate user, a soft decoding rule is considered.

sampling signals with finite rate of innovation. even though these signals are not bandlimited, we show that they can be sampled uniformly at (or above) the rate of innovation using an appropriate kernel and then be perfectly reconstructed. thus, we prove sampling theorems for classes of signals and kernels that generalize the classic  bandlimited and sinc kernel  case. in particular, we show how to sample and reconstruct periodic and finite length streams of diracs, nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials using sinc and gaussian kernels. for infinite length signals with finite local rate of innovation, we show local sampling and reconstruction based on spline kernels. this leads to standard computational procedures for solving the sampling problem, which we show through experimental results.

residues within the b motif are critical for dna binding by the superfamily # helicase rep## of adeno associated virus type #. abstract we have recently published the crystal structure of the adeno associated virus type # superfamily # (sf#) helicase rep##. here we focused our attention on residues that fall within and adjacent to the b    motif of sf# helicases that directly interact with single stranded dna during translocation of the motor protein. in vitro, alanine substitution at positions lys ### or lys ### abrogated the ability of the protein to interact with single stranded dna as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and fluorescence anisotropy, and accordingly these mutants could not unwind a partially duplex dna substrate. taken together, we characterized, for the first time in an sf# helicase family member, residues that are directly involved in single stranded dna binding and that are critical for the rep motor activity. based on our findings we propose b    as the signature motif of sf# helicases that is responsible for the complex interactions required for the coupling of dna binding and atp hydrolysis.

the alternative sigma factor sigh regulates major components of oxidative and heat stress responses in mycobacterium tuberculosis. sigh is an alternative sigma factor that we have previously shown plays a role in the response to stress of the saprophyte mycobacterium smegmatis. in this work we investigated the role of sigh in the m. we determined that a m. we also determined that the sigh mutant is more susceptible to heat stress and that inducible expression of the heat shock genes dnak and clpb is positively regulated by sigh. the induction of these heat shock gene promoters but not of other sigh dependent promoters was markedly greater in response to heat versus oxidative stress, consistent with their additional regulation by a heat labile repressor. tuberculosis stress response, we investigated the regulation of the stress responsive sigma factor genes sige and sigb. we determined that inducible expression of sige is regulated by sigh and that basal and inducible expression of sigb is dependent on sige and sigh.

learning convolutional feature hierarchies for visual recognition. we propose an unsupervised method for learning multi stage hierarchies of sparse convolutional features. by training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves the efficiency of the overall representation. in addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efficient feed forward encoder that predicts quasi sparse features from the input. while patch based training rarely produces anything but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse filters, including center surround filters, corner detectors, cross detectors, and oriented grating detectors. we show that using these filters in multistage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks.

optimistic linear programming gives logarithmic regret for irreducible mdps. we present an algorithm called optimistic linear programming (olp) for learning to optimize average reward in an irreducible but otherwise unknown markov decision process (mdp). we show that the total expected reward obtained by olp up to time t is within c(p) log t of the reward obtained by the optimal policy, where c(p) is an explicit, mdp dependent constant. olp is closely related to an algorithm proposed by burnetas and katehakis with four key differences  olp is simpler, it does not require knowledge of the supports of transition probabilities, the proof of the regret bound is simpler, but our regret bound is a constant factor larger than the regret of their algorithm.
do bonds span volatility risk in the u s treasury market a specification test for affine term structure models. we investigate whether bonds span the volatility risk in the u.s. to this end, we construct powerful and model free empirical measures of the quadratic yield variation for a cross section of fixed maturity zero coupon bonds ( realized yield volatility ) through the use of high frequency data. we find that the yield curve fails to span yield volatility, as the systematic volatility factors are largely unrelated to the cross section of yields. we conclude that a broad class of affine diffusive, gaussian quadratic and affine jump diffusive models is incapable of accommodating the observed yield volatility dynamics. we also advocate using the empirical realized yield volatility measures more broadly as a basis for specification testing and (parametric) model selection within the term structure literature.

vibrations of a gas column. an explanation of this phenomenon was recently suggested by mr t a c o n i s. this led to the present paper in which we investigate in detail the sign of the damping of the small oscillations which the gas may perform. although we find that owing to the temperature variation there may be a marked tendency towards a negative damping of the vibrations it appears that in many cases this effect does not suffice to account for the observed instability.

distributed static var systems svs for regulated voltage support of load centers. this paper shows that when load centers require static var systems (svs) for regulated voltage control, the strategy of using many, small, distributed svs located at distribution buses is more advantageous than a few large bulk svs located at the transmission or subtransmission bus. the advantages are  (i) standby to meet n # reliability criterion is reduced  (ii) costly high voltage transformers are no longer needed because the svs can be connected directly to the low voltage distribution buses  (iii) distribution side voltage support is more effective so that the total mvar requirement of the distributed svs is less.

barrier heights in the kauffman model. we consider two versions of the kauffman model (the quenched and the annealed models) in presence of thermal noise. when we compare the time evolution of two configurations subjected to the same thermal noise, we find for both versions of the kauffman model that below a critical temperature t c , the time    #  for these two configurations to become identical increases exponentially with the system size n. when we compare more than two configurations, we observe that the time    n  it takes for at least two configurations among n to meet increases also exponentially. the slope of log    n  versus the system size n seems to be the same for all n and for both models  nous considerons deux versions du modele de kauffman (le modele gele et le modele recuit) en presence de bruit.

local adaptation and effect of host genotype on the rate of pathogen evolution an experimental test in a plant pathosystem. if evolution occurs faster in pathogen populations than in host populations, the predicted result is local adaptation of the pathogen population. in our studies, we used a combination of molecular and physiological markers to test these hypotheses in an agricultural system. we isolated five strains of the fungal pathogen mycosphaerella graminicola from each of two wheat cultivars that differed in their level of resistance to this pathogen. we also measured the virulence of these ## fungal strains and correlated it to the reproductive fitness of each fungal strain. we found that host genotypes had a strong impact on the dynamics of the pathogen populations. our results also revealed that the measures of reproductive fitness and virulence of a pathogen strain were not always correlated. the pathogen strains varied in their patterns of local adaptation, ranging from locally adapted to locally maladapted.

castration resistance in human prostate cancer is conferred by a frequently occurring androgen receptor splice variant. here we have identified what we believe to be a novel human ar splice variant in which exons #, #, and # are deleted (arv###es) and demonstrated that this variant can contribute to cancer progression in human prostate cancer xenograft models in mice following castration. we determined that, in human prostate cancer cell lines, arv###es functioned as a constitutively active receptor, increased expression of full length ar (arfl), and enhanced the transcriptional activity of ar. in human xenografts, human prostate cancer cells transfected with arv###es cdna formed tumors that were resistant to castration. importantly, we also detected arv###es frequently in human prostate cancer metastases. in summary, these data indicate that constitutively active ar splice variants can contribute to the development of castration resistant prostate cancers and may serve as biomarkers for patients who are likely to suffer from early recurrence and are candidates for therapies directly targeting the ar rather than ligand.

a new twist two step iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithms for image restoration. it happens that the convergence rate of these #st algorithms depends heavily on the linear observation operator, becoming very slow when this operator is ill conditioned or ill posed. in this paper, we introduce two step #st (twist) algorithms, exhibiting much faster convergence rate than #st for ill conditioned problems. for a vast class of nonquadratic convex regularizers (lscr p  norms, some besov norms, and total variation), we show that twist converges to a minimizer of the objective function, for a given range of values of its parameters. for noninvertible observation operators, we introduce a monotonic version of twist (mtwist)  although the convergence proof does not apply to this scenario, we give experimental evidence that mtwist exhibits similar speed gains over ist. the effectiveness of the new methods are experimentally confirmed on problems of image deconvolution and of restoration with missing
can the labile carbon contribute to carbon immobilization in semiarid soils priming effects and microbial community dynamics. we studied priming effects and microbial utilization of glucose as an example of bioavailable labile molecule in the carbon cycle of a semiarid soil. our data indicated that the intense metabolism of som due to priming phenomena compromises the
the rational complementarity problem. since the rcp is crucial both in issues concerning existence and uniqueness of solutions to complementarity systems and in time simulation of complementarity systems, it is worthwhile to consider existence and uniqueness questions of solutions to the rcp. in this paper necessary and sufficient conditions are presented guaranteeing existence and uniqueness of solutions to the rcp in terms of corresponding lcps. using these results and proving that the corresponding lcps have certain properties, we can show uniqueness and existence of solutions to linear mechanical systems with unilateral constraints, electrical networks with diodes, and linear dynamical systems subject to relays and or
effect of dominance status on sex hormone levels in laboratory and wild spawning male trout. we investigated the relationship between male social status and hormone levels in salmonids spawning under laboratory and field conditions. in small groups of rainbow trout (onchorhynchus mykiss) spawning in the laboratory, dominant males had higher plasma levels of testosterone (t) and ##  ,##   dihydroxy # pregnen # one (##,##   p) compared with subordinates. steroid levels increased in subordinate males that became dominant after dominant males were experimentally removed  higher steroid levels in dominant males appears to be a result rather than a cause of their social status. in free ranging brown trout (salmo trutta) sampled in the field, we found higher levels of ## ketotestosterone (##kt) but not t in dominant males.

bayesian source localization in networks with heterogeneous transmission medium. most of the localization algorithms are vulnerable to the variations of signal propagation speed, dielectric constant, and path loss coefficient resulting in unreliable location estimation. in this paper, we propose a novel robust probabilistic bayesian based approach using received signal strength (rss) measurements with varying path loss exponent in wireless networks with heterogeneous medium. the results of this study showed that the localization root mean square error (rmse) of our bayesian based method when a sensor node was covered by four anchors was #.#   mm which is smaller than that of other existing localization approaches under the same conditions such as classical mds (##.#   mm), dwmds (##.#   mm), mle (##.#   mm) and pocs (#.#   mm).

a survey of mobility models for ad hoc network research. this paper is a survey of mobility models that are used in the simulations of ad hoc networks. we describe several mobility models that represent mobile nodes whose movements are independent of each other (i.e., entity mobility models) and several mobility models that represent mobile nodes whose movements are dependent on each other (i.e., group mobility models). the goal of this paper is to present a number of mobility models in order to offer researchers more informed choices when they are deciding upon a mobility model to use in their performance evaluations. lastly, we present simulation results that illustrate the importance of choosing a mobility model in the simulation of an ad hoc network protocol. specifically, we illustrate how the performance results of an ad hoc network protocol drastically change as a result of changing the mobility model simulated.

mutation in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor ii as a cause of primary pulmonary hypertension in a large kindred. because clinical disease develops in only ## to ## percent of persons carrying the gene for familial primary pulmonary hypertension, we hypothesized that many patients with apparently sporadic primary pulmonary hypertension may actually have familial primary pulmonary hypertension. methods in a study conducted over ## years, we developed a registry of ## families affected by familial primary pulmonary hypertension. through patient referrals, extensive family histories, and correlation of family pedigrees, we discovered shared ancestry among five subfamilies. we assessed some family members for mutations in the gene encoding bone morphogenetic protein receptor ii (bmpr#), which has recently been found to cause familial primary pulmonary hypertension. results we linked five separately identified subfamilies that included ### known members spanning seven generations, which were traced back to a ...
sources of time variation in the covariance matrix of interest rates. the main objective of this paper is to study the sources of time variation in the covariance matrix of interest rates. we depart from the traditional standard deviation   correlation decomposition of covariances and investigate whether time variation in the covariance matrix of bond yield changes is caused by time varying eigenvalues and or eigenvectors. on the basis of a formal testing procedure, we find that common factors display a clear time varying volatility over the past three decades. most notably, we observe that the switches in monetary policy that take place with the appointment of a new federal reserve chairman play an important role in characterizing the time variation in the loadings on the common factors that drive interest rates.

the gamma ray burst hubble diagram and its implications for cosmology. in this paper, we continue to build support for the proposal to use gamma ray bursts (grbs) as standard candles in constructing the hubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of type ia supernova observations. we confirm that correlations among certain spectral and light curve features can indeed be used as luminosity indicators, and demonstrate from the most up to date grb sample appropriate for this work that the lambda cdm model optimized with these data is characterized by parameter values consistent with those in the concordance model. specifically, we find that (omega(m), omega(lambda)) approximate to (#.##( #.##)(+#.##), we also carry out a comparative analysis between lambda cdm and the r h   ct universe and find that the optimal lambda cdm model fits the grb hubble diagram with a reduced chi(#)(dof) approximate to #.##, whereas the fit using r h   ct results in a chi(#)(dof) approximate to #.##. in both cases, about ##  of the events lie at least # sigma away from the best fit curves, suggesting that either some contamination by non standard grb luminosities is unavoidable or that the errors and intrinsic scatter associated with the data are being underestimated. with these optimized fits, we use three statistical tools the akaike information criterion, the kullback information criterion, and the bayes information criterion to show that, based on the grb hubble diagram, the likelihood of r h   ct being closer to the correct model is similar to ##  ## , compared to similar to #  ##  for lambda cdm.

observational probes of cosmic acceleration. we review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements  type ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (bao), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. we pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit    stage iv    dark energy facilities such as bigboss, lsst, euclid, and wfirst. we briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift space distortions, the alcock   paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the hubble constant h #. we present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from general relativity, achievable with stage iii and stage iv experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, bao, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. we also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. we emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information.

subtopic structuring for full length document access. we argue that the advent of large volumes of full length text, as opposed to short texts like abstracts and newswire, should be accompanied by corresponding new approaches to information access. toward this end, we discuss the merits of imposing  structure  on full length text documents  that is, a partition of the text into coherent multi paragraph units that represent the pattern of subtopics that comprise the text. using this structure, we can make a distinction between the main topics, which occur throughout the length of the text, and the subtopics, which are of only limited extent. we discuss why recognition of subtopic structure is important and how, to some degree of accuracy, it can be found. we describe a new way of specifying queries on full length documents  and then describe an experiment in which making use of the recognition of local structure achieves better results on a typical information retrieval task than does a

stable structure from motion for unordered image collections. we present a non incremental approach to structure from motion. our solution is based on robustly computing global rotations from relative geometries and feeding these into the known rotation framework to create an initial solution for bundle adjustment. to increase robustness we present a new method for constructing reliable point tracks from pairwise matches. we show that our method can be seen as maximizing the reliability of a point track if the quality of the weakest link in the track is used to evaluate reliability. to estimate the final geometry we alternate between bundle adjustment and a robust version of the known rotation formulation. the ability to compute both structure and camera translations independent of initialization makes our algorithm insensitive to degenerate epipolar geometries. we demonstrate the performance of our system on a number of image collections.

early p## positive foci as indicators of tumor risk in ultraviolet exposed hairless mice kinetics of induction effects of dna repair deficiency and p## heterozygosity. clusters of epidermal cells that express p## in mutant conformation (   p## positive foci   ) are easily detected by immunohistochemical staining long before the appearance of skin carcinomas or their precursor lesions. in a hairless mouse model, we determined the dose time dependency of the induction of these p##+ foci and investigated the relationship with the induction of skin carcinomas. to further validate the density of p##+ foci as a direct measure of tumor risk, we carried out experiments with transgenic mice with an enhanced susceptibility to uv carcinogenesis, homozygous  xpa  knockout mice (deficient in nucleotide excision repair) and heterozygous  p##  knockout mice (i.a.

the psychology of physical symptoms. we all experience them, use them as signals to guide our behavior, and usually assume that they accurately represent underlying physiological activity. at the same time, we implicitly know that bodily sensations are often vague, ambiguous, and subject to a variety of interpretations. it is not surprising, then, that there is often a disparity between what we think is going on in our bodies and what is objectively occurring. my own research into physical symptoms started by accident several years ago. in a hastily devised experiment dealing with the effects of noise on behavior, i had to write a post experimental questionnaire that would be long enough to allow the experimenter time to calibrate some equipment for a later portion of the study. people s perceptions of symptoms were easily influenced by our manipulations, even though their actual physiological state had not changed.
unstructural biology coming of age. here, it is suggested that the transition is set up by the synergy of  (i) more advanced bioinformatic tools for the prediction of disorder and function of idps, (ii) ensemble description of their structure and dynamics in both free and bound states, down to the single molecule level, (iii) advent of in cell approaches for characterizing their structure and function  in vivo , and (iv) generation of small molecule inhibitors both against their binding partners and idps themselves. in all, we suggest that due to steady advance in these areas, the field of    unstructural    biology is rapidly maturing to a state where it can provide quantitative models of proteins functioning without well defined three dimensional

spectrum behavior learning in cognitive radio based on artificial neural network. therefore, the prerequisite for being    cognitive    lies in a deeper understanding of the characteristics of current spectrum behavior, such as a better model for spectrum behavior prediction, so as to design better and more efficient spectrum sensing and access schemes for secondary users in cr. a practical spectrum behavior learning method based on multilayer perception (mlp) artificial neural network (ann) is introduced in this paper, by which, state of different channels in future timeslots (either idle or busy) can be forecasted through supervised learning such that cr nodes can create a handover channel list in advance without interruption to its ongoing transmission. the empirical results show that the method proposed in this paper can well fit the future spectrum behavior with the mean root mean square error (rmse) as low as #.##.

the asymptotic properties of gmm and indirect inference under second order identification. this paper presents a limiting distribution theory for gmm and indirect inference estimators when local identification conditions fail at first order but hold at second order. these limit distributions are shown to be non standard, but we show that they can be easily simulated, making it possible to perform inference about the parameters in this setting. we illustrate our results in the context of a dynamic panel data model in which the parameter of interest is identified locally at second order by non linear moment restrictions but not at first order at a particular point in the parameter space. our simulation results indicate that our theory leads to reliable inferences in moderate to large samples in the neighbourhood of this point of first order identification failure. in contrast, inferences based on standard asymptotic theory (derived under the assumption of first order local identification) are very misleading in the neighbourhood of the point of first order local identification failure.

a qtl on distal chromosome # that influences the severity of light induced damage to mouse photoreceptors. our results revealed a strong and highly significant quantitative trait locus (qtl) on mouse chromosome (chr) # that contributes almost ##  of the c#j protective effect, and three other very weak but significant qtls on chrs #, ##, and ##. interestingly, the chrs # and ## qtls corresponded to relative susceptibility alleles in c#j (or relative protection alleles in balb c), the opposite of the relative protective effect of the qtls on chrs # and ##. we mapped the rpe## gene to the apex of the chr # qtl (lod score   ##.#).
the association between glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins and heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunits in lymphocytes. here we show that gpi anchored proteins are associated with alpha subunits of heterotrimeric gtp binding proteins (g proteins) in both human and murine lymphocytes. when the gpi anchored proteins cd##, cd##, and thy # were immunoprecipitated from various cell lines or freshly isolated lymphocytes, all were found to be associated with a ## kda phosphoprotein that we have identified, by using specific antisera, as a mixture of tyrosine phosphorylated g protein alpha subunits  a small amount of gialpha#, and substantial amounts of gialpha# and gialpha#. thus, we have shown by both immunochemical and functional criteria that gpi anchored proteins are physically associated with g proteins.

transcription factor ap# and its role in epidermal specific gene expression. to elucidate factors controlling keratinocyte specific gene expression, we previously identified proximal and distal regulatory elements that act synergistically to drive keratinocyte specific expression of the gene encoding human epidermal keratin k##. control by the proximal element is mediated by a transcription factor, ker#, which is more abundant in nuclear extracts of keratinocytes than in extracts of other cell types, including fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and simple epithelial cells. in this report, we identify this factor as transcription factor ap#, shown to be transcribed in cells of epidermal and neural crest lineages. furthermore, we demonstrate functional ap# binding sites upstream from three additional epidermal genes, suggesting that ap# may be generally involved in epidermal gene regulation.

learning depth from single monocular images. we consider the task of depth estimation from a single monocular image. we take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured outdoor environments which include forests, trees, buildings, etc.) and their corresponding ground truth depthmaps. then, we apply supervised learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. our model uses a discriminatively trained markov random field (mrf) that incorporates multiscale local  and global image features, and models both depths at individual points as well as the relation between depths at different points. we show that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able to recover fairly accurate depthmaps.

herpes simplex virus type # infection of activated cytotoxic t cells induction of fratricide as a mechanism of viral immune evasion. we have observed that in contrast to the situation in human fibroblasts, in human t cell lines antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class i molecules is not blocked after hsv# infection. to dissect the underlying molecular events, we used a transgenic mouse model of hsv# infection to demonstrate that cd## (apo #, fas) triggered apoptosis is essential for hsv# induced fratricide, whereas tumor necrosis factor (tnf) also contributes to this phenomenon but to a lesser extent. finally, we defined two mechanisms associated with hsv# associated fratricide of antiviral t cells  (a) t cell receptor   mediated upregulation of cd## ligand and (b) a viral    competence to die    signal that renders activated t lymphocytes susceptible to cd## signaling. we propose that induction of fratricide is an important immune evasion mechanism of hsv#, helping the virus to persist in the host organism throughout its lifetime.

trp channels in neurogastroenterology opportunities for therapeutic intervention. during the last decade, a vast amount of evidence is accumulating that attributes an important role to these cation channels in different regulatory aspects of the alimentary tract. in this review we discuss the expression patterns and roles of trp channels in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility, enteric nervous system signalling and visceral sensation, and provide our perspectives on pharmacological targeting of trps as a strategy to treat various gastrointestinal disorders. we found that the current knowledge about the role of some members of the trp superfamily in neurogastroenterology is rather limited, whereas the function of other trp channels, especially of those implicated in smooth muscle cell contractility (trpc#, trpc#), visceral sensitivity and hypersensitivity (trpv#, trpv#, trpa#), tends to be well established.

il ## has stimulatory activity for the induction of b cell proliferation and differentiation. although it has no sequence identity with il #, il ## shares many of the t cell stimulatory activities described for il #. we have examined il ## for its ability to stimulate b cells and have compared its activity with that of il #. il ## costimulates proliferation of b cells activated with immobilized anti human igm or phorbol ester, but has no stimulatory effect on resting b cells. in combination with recombinant cd##l, il ## is a potent inducer of polyclonal igm, igg#, and iga secretion, but does not cause production of igg# or ige. the activity of il ## in b cell proliferation and differentiation assays is comparable with that of il #. studies that used neutralizing abs have demonstrated that, for signal transduction in b cells, il ## uses the beta chain of the il #r complex but, unlike il #, does not require the alpha chain.

toward a theory of whistleblowing intentions a benefit to cost differential perspective. however, an integrative theory that explains how they influence whistleblowing intentions has been conspicuously absent. in this research, we introduce and test a middle range theory of whistleblowing that can explain how and why a variety of factors may influence an individual s whistleblowing intentions. drawing on the social information processing perspective, we propose that individuals holistically weigh the perceived    benefit to cost differential    and that this mediates the relationship between whistleblowing factors and whistleblowing intentions. tests using data collected from ### experienced it project managers largely support our theoretical perspective, in which the central explanatory variable (benefit to cost differential) significantly mediates a majority of the proposed relationships.
lower body negative pressure as a model to study progression to acute hemorrhagic shock in humans. lower body negative pressure (lbnp) sequesters blood from the thorax into dependent regions of the pelvis and legs, effectively decreasing central blood volume in a similar fashion as acute hemorrhage. in this review, we compare physiological responses to hemorrhage and lbnp with particular emphasis on cardiovascular compensations that both share in common. through evaluation of animal and human data, we present evidence that supports the hypothesis that lbnp, and resulting volume sequestration, is an effective technique to study physiological responses and mechanisms associated with acute hemorrhage in humans.

in vitro transcription of pe## polyhedrin hybrid promoters reveals sequences essential for recognition by the baculovirus induced rna polymerase and for the strength of very late viral promoters. by modifying the preparation of crude nuclear extracts, we have established an assay that permits differentiation between weak late and strong very late viral promoters. based on the sensitivity of our in vitro transcription system, we have investigated the sequences responsible for a functional taag motif and their putative role with respect to the strength of very late promoters. by constructing hybrid promoters between the early pe## and the very late polyhedrin promoters, we demonstrated that the replacement of # nucleotides upstream of the nonfunctional taag sequences in the pe## promoter with the corresponding sequences of the polyhedrin promoter was sufficient for recognition by the virus induced rna polymerase.
reduction of phonon thermal conductivity in nanowires and nanoribbons with dynamically rough surfaces and edges. we present an analytical model and molecular dynamics simulations of the phonon heat transport in nanowires and nanoribbons with anharmonic lattices and dynamically rough surfaces and edges. in agreement with recent experiments on heat transport in single crystalline silicon nanowires with rough surfaces, our model and simulations predict finite and length independent phonon thermal conductivity in such quasi   one dimensional systems, in contrast to anomalous phonon thermal conductivity of corresponding momentum conserving systems with atomically smooth surfaces, divergent with the system length. within our model, the main cause of thermal conductivity reduction is the momentum nonconserving scattering of longitudinal acoustic phonons by anharmonic side phonon leads in quasi   one dimensional phonon waveguides with dynamically rough surface or edge layers. we also show that the superdiffusion of thermal energy in nanoribbons with atomically smooth edges is replaced by the normal diffusion or subdiffusion in nanoribbons with dynamically rough edges.

distributed spectrum allocation via local bargaining. in this paper, we present an adaptive and distributed approach to spectrum allocation in mobile ad hoc networks. we propose a local bargaining approach where users affected by the mobility event self organize into bargaining groups and adapt their spectrum assignment to approximate a new optimal assignment. the number of computations required to adapt to topology changes can be significantly reduced compared to that of the conventional topology based optimizations that ignore the prior assignment. in particular, we propose a fairness bargaining with feed poverty to improve fairness in spectrum assignment and derive a theoretical lower bound on the minimum assignment each user can get from bargaining for certain network configurations. we also show that the difference between the proposed bargaining approach and the true optimal approach is upper bounded.
the coding of uniform colour figures in monkey visual cortex. the visual cortex emphasizes contrast borders, but it is unclear whether colour surface signals also exist, whether colour border signals are orientation selective or mainly non oriented, and whether cortical processing tends to separate colour and form information. to address these questions we examined the representation of uniform colour figures by recording single neuron activity from areas v# and v# in alert macaque monkeys during behaviourally induced fixation. based on response profiles across a # deg square figure, and the relative frequency of oriented and non oriented cells, we estimate that the cortical colour signal is #   # times stronger for the edges than for the surface of the figure.

rapid sequence divergence in mammalian    defensins by adaptive evolution. we have analysed the largest murine and human clusters of these genes, which localise to mouse and human chromosome #. using hidden markov models, we identified novel mouse and human    defensin genes. we subsequently found full length expressed transcripts for these novel genes. in the human we also conclude that the locus has evolved by successive rounds of duplication followed by substantial divergence involving positive selection, to produce a diverse cluster of paralogous genes prior to human baboon divergence. in order to look at function of these rapidly evolving genes, we characterised one of the novel mouse    defensin genes.
organophosphate poisoning a method to test therapeutic effects of oxamines other than acetylcholinesterase activation in the rat.
vanilloid receptors on sensory nerves mediate the vasodilator action of anandamide. here we show that the vasodilator response to anandamide in isolated arteries is capsaicin sensitive and accompanied by release of calcitonin gene related peptide (cgrp). our results indicate that anandamide induces vasodilation by activating vanilloid receptors on perivascular sensory nerves and causing release of cgrp. the vanilloid receptor may thus be another molecular target for endogenous anandamide, besides cannabinoid receptors, in the nervous and cardiovascular systems.

bayesian hierarchical distributed lag models for summer ozone exposure and cardio respiratory mortality. in this paper, we develop bayesian hierarchical distributed lag models for estimating associations between daily variations in summer ozone levels and daily variations in cardiovascular and respiratory (cvdresp) mortality counts for ## u.s. at the first stage, we define a semi parametric distributed lag poisson regression model to estimate city specific relative rates of cvdresp associated with short term exposure to summer ozone. at the second stage, we specify a class of distributions for the true city specific relative rates to estimate an overall effect by taking into account the variability within and across cities. we perform the calculations with respect to several random effects distributions (normal, t student, and mixture of normal), thus relaxing the common assumption of a two stage normal normal hierarchical model. we assess the sensitivity of the results to  #) lag structure for ozone exposure  #) degree of adjustment for long term trends  #) inclusion of other pollutants in the model #) heat waves  #) random effects distributions  and #) prior hyperparameters. on average across cities, we found that a ##ppb increase in summer ozone level for every day in the previous week is associated with #.## percent increase in cvdresp mortality (##  posterior regions  #.##, #.##). the relative rate estimates are also positive and statistically significant at lags #, #, and #. we found that associations between summer ozone and cvdresp mortality are sensitive to the confounding adjustment for pm ##, but are robust to  #) the adjustment for long term trends, other gaseous pollutants (no #, so #, and co)  #) the distributional assumptions at the second stage of the hierarchical model  and #) the prior distributions on all unknown parameters. bayesian hierarchical distributed lag models and their application to the nmmaps data allow us estimation of an acute health effect associated with exposure to ambient air pollution in the last few days on average across several locations.

finding frequent items in data streams. we present a # pass algorithm for estimating the most frequent items in a data stream using limited storage space. our method relies on a data structure called a count sketch, which allows us to reliably estimate the frequencies of frequent items in the stream. our algorithm achieves better space bounds than the previously known best algorithms for this problem for several natural distributions on the item frequencies. in addition, our algorithm leads directly to a # pass algorithm for the problem of estimating the items with the largest (absolute) change in frequency between two data streams. to our knowledge, this latter problem has not been previously studied in the literature.

west nile virus evades activation of interferon regulatory factor # through rig i dependent and independent pathways without antagonizing host defense signaling. we have previously shown that west nile virus ny (wnv ny) delays activation of interferon regulatory factor # (irf #), a transcription factor critical to the initiation of the antiviral response. here we demonstrate that the delayed activation of irf # is essential for wnv ny to achieve maximum virus production. to better understand this process, we assessed the role of the pathogen recognition receptor (prr) retinoic acid inducible gene i (rig i) in sensing wnv ny infection. our data suggest that activation of the host response by rig i early in infection is important for controlling replication of wnv ny.

analysis of link failures in an ip backbone. however, performance degradation and service disruption are likely in the case of failure, such as fiber cuts, router crashes, etc. in this paper, we investigate the occurence of failures in sprint s ip backbone and their potential impact on emerging services such as voice over ip (voip). we first examine the frequency and duration of failure events derived from is is routing updates collected from three different points in the sprint ip backbone. we observe that link failures occur as part of everyday operation, and the majority of them are short lived (less than ## minutes). we also discuss various statistics such as the distribution of inter failure time, distribution of link failure durations, etc. which are essential for constructing a realistic link failure model. next, we present an analysis of routing and service reconvergence time during a controlled link failure scenario in our backbone. our results indicate that disruption to packet forwarding after link failures depends not only on routing protocol dynamics, but also on the design of routers  architectures and control planes. thus our results offer insights into two basic components for defining network wide availability, which we consider a more appropriate metric for service level agreements to support emerging applications.

measuring national delegate positions at the convention on the future of europe using computerized word scoring. in this paper, we attempt to measure these preferences at the national party level by analysing the convention texts using the computerized        word scoring         method for text analysis (laver et al., ####). for each national party whose delegates         texts were recorded at the convention, we estimate their positions on four political dimensions. we then test the validity of these estimates by comparing them with measures of national party positions on eu policy dimensions obtained through an extensive expert survey undertaken in ## countries (the eu ## plus turkey and romania). our results show strong evidence that the word scoring method is broadly successful in reconstructing the map of national party preferences for and against a more centralized and more powerful europe as expressed through the convention texts.

learning and transferring mid level image representations using convolutional neural networks. this property currently prevents application of cnns to problems with limited training data. in this work we show how image representations learned with cnns on large scale annotated datasets can be efficiently transferred to other visual recognition tasks with limited amount of training data. we design a method to reuse layers trained on the imagenet dataset to compute mid level image representation for images in the pascal voc dataset. we show that despite differences in image statistics and tasks in the two datasets, the transferred rep  resentation leads to significantly improved results for object and action classification, outperforming the current state of the art on pascal voc #### and #### datasets. we also show promising results for object and action localization.

a total system approach to sustainable pest management. to date, we have failed to incorporate this basic principle into the mainstream of pest management science and continue to regress into a foot race with nature. in this report, we establish why a total system approach is essential as the guiding premise of pest management and provide arguments as to how earlier attempts for change and current mainstream initiatives generally fail to follow this principle. we then draw on emerging knowledge about multitrophic level interactions and other specific findings about management of ecosystems to propose a pivotal redirection of pest management strategies that would honor this principle and, thus, be sustainable. finally, we discuss the potential immense benefits of such a central shift in pest management philosophy.

changes in end tidal co# level following tourniquet deflation during orthopedic surgery. we studied the changes in end tidal co# (etco#) and systemic responses after tourniquet deflation in spontaneously breathing and ventilation controlled patients during orthopedic surgery of both the upper and or the lower extremities. our study yielded new information on the etco# changes as follows  #) the time for etco# level to reach a peak (peak time) was almost constant despite the considerable differences in the increases in etco# both in spontaneous breathing and ventilation controlled groups and the peak time in the former group was shorter than that in the latter group  and #) it was suggested that the increase in etco# in the spontaneously breathing patients was smaller than that in ventilation controlled patients when both patients were subjected to the same conditions on tourniquet time and tourniqueted area. our data showed that the increase in etco# (or paco#) can be large and prolonged in some situations. thus, we recommend continuous etco# monitoring and the proper hyperventilation at tourniquet deflation in order to minimize any adverse effects of acidosis.
